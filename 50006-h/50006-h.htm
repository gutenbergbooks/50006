FEW only are the remarks absolutely needed by
way of introduction to a work which within
itself sufficiently explains and carries out a new
method of illustration for the dramas of Shakespeare.
As author, I commenced this volume because of
various observations which, while reading several of the early
Emblem writers, I had made on similarities of thought and
expression between themselves and the great Poet; and I had
sketched the whole outline, and had nearly filled it in, without
knowing that the path pursued by me had in any instance been
trodden by other amateurs and critics. From the writings of
the profoundly learned Francis Douce, whose name ought never
to be uttered without deep respect for his rare scholarship
and generous regard to its interests, I first became aware that
Shakespeare’s direct quotation of Emblem mottoes, and direct
description of Emblem devices, had in some degree been already
pointed out to the attention of the literary public.</p>

<p class='c000'>And right glad am I to observe that I have had precursors
in my labours, and companions in my researches; and that, in
addition to Francis Douce, writers of such repute as Langlois
of Rouen, Charles Knight, Noel Humphreys, and Dr. Alfred
Woltmann, of Berlin, have, each by an example or two, shown
how, with admirable skill and yet with evident appropriation,
<span class='pageno' title='viii' id='Page_viii'></span>our great Dramatist has interwoven among his own the materials
which he had gathered from Emblem writers as their source.</p>

<p class='c000'>To myself the fact is an assurance that neither from aiming
at singularity of conjecture, nor from pretending to a more
penetrating insight into Shakespeare’s methods of composition,
have I put before the world the following pages for judgment.
Those pages are the results of genuine study,—a study I could
not have so well pursued had not liberal-minded friends freely
entrusted to my use the book-treasures which countervailed
my own deficiencies. The results arrived at, though imperfect,
are also, I believe, grounded on real similitudes between
Shakespeare and his predecessors and contemporaries; and
those similitudes, parallelisms, or adaptations of thought, by
whichever name distinguished, often arose from the actual
impression made on his mind and memory by the Emblematists
whose works he had seen, read, and used.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a suitable Frontispiece the portraits are presented of five
celebrated authors of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries: one
a German—Sebastian Brandt; three Italian—Andrew Alciat,
Paolo Giovio, and Achilles Bocchius; and one from Hungary—John
Sambucus. They were all men of learning and renown,
whom kings and emperors honoured, and whom the foremost of
their age admired. The central portrait, that of Bocchius of
Bologna, is from the famous artist Giulio Bonasone, and the
original engraving was retouched by Augustino Caracci. The
other portraits have been reduced from the “<span class='sc'>Icones</span>,” or
<cite>Figures of Fifty Illustrious Men</cite>, which Theodore de Bry
executed and published during Shakespeare’s prime, in 1597.
In their own day they were regarded as correct delineations and
likenesses, and are said to be authentic copies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vignette of Shakespeare on the title-page is now
<span class='pageno' title='ix' id='Page_ix'></span>engraved for the first time. The original is an oil-painting, a
head of the life size, and possessing considerable animation
and evidences of power. It is the property of Charles Clay,
Esq., M.D., Manchester. Without vouching for its authenticity,
we are justified in saying, when it is compared with some other
portraits, that it offers equal, if not superior, claims to genuineness.
To discuss the question does not belong to these pages,
but simply and cordially to acknowledge the courtesy with
which the oil-painting was offered for use and allowed to be
copied, and to say that our woodcut is an accurate and well-executed
representation of the original picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the ornamental capitals at the head of the chapters, and
of the little embellishments at their end, it may be remarked
that, with scarcely an exception, there are none later than our
Poet’s day, and but few that do not belong to Emblem books:
they are forty-eight in number. The illustrative woodcuts
and photolith plates, of which there are one hundred and
fifty-three of the former and nineteen of the latter, partake of
the variety, and, it may be said, apologetically, of the defects
of the works from which they have been taken. However
fanciful in themselves, they are realities,—true exponents of the
Emblem art of their day; so that, within the compass of our
volume, containing above two hundred examples of emblematic
devices and designs, is exhibited a very full representation of
the various styles of the original works, and which, in the
absence of the works themselves, may serve to show their chief
characteristics. The Photoliths, I may add, have been executed
by Mr. A. Brothers, of Manchester.</p>

<p class='c000'>Doubtless both the woodcuts and the plates are very
unequal in their execution; but to have aimed at a uniformity
even of high excellence would have been to sacrifice truth to
<span class='pageno' title='x' id='Page_x'></span>mere embellishment. It should be borne in mind what one of
our objects has been,—namely, to place before the reader
examples of the Emblem devices themselves, very nearly as
they existed in their own day, and not to attempt the ideal
perfection to which modern art rightly aspires.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Edition of Shakespeare from which the extracts are
taken is the very excellent one, in nine volumes, issued from
Cambridge, 1863–1866. Its numbering of the lines for purposes
of reference is most valuable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our work offers information, and consequently advantage, to
three classes of the literary public:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1st. To the Book Agent and Book Antiquarian, so far as
relates to books of Emblems previous to the early part of the
seventeenth century, <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1616. In a collected and methodical
form, aided not a little by the General Index, the first chapters
and sections of our volume supply information that is widely
scattered, and not to be obtained without considerable trouble
and search. The authors, titles, and dates of the <em>chief</em> editions of
Emblem books within the period treated of, are clearly though
briefly given, arranged according to the languages in which the
books were printed, and accompanied where requisite by notices
and remarks. There is not to be found, I believe, in any other
work so much information about the early Emblem books,
gathered together in so compendious and orderly a manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>2nd. To the Students and Scholars of Shakespeare,—a
widely-extended and ever-increasing community. Another
aspect of the Master’s reading and attainments is opened to
them; and into the yet unquarried illustrations of which his
marvellous writings are susceptible, another adit is driven. We
may have followed him through Histories and Legends, through
the Epic and the Ballad, through Popular Tales and Philosophic
<span class='pageno' title='xi' id='Page_xi'></span>Treatises,—from the forest glade to the halls and gardens of
palaces,—across the wild moor where the weird sisters muttered
and prophesied, and to that moon-lighted bank where the sweet
Jessica was sitting in all maiden loveliness;—but if only for
variety’s sake it may interest us, even if it does not impart pleasure,
to mark how much his mind was in accord with the once
popular Emblem literature, which now perchance awakens
scarcely a thought or a regret, though great scholars and men of
genius devoted themselves to it; and how from that literature,
imbued with its spirit and heightening its power, even he—the
self-reliant one—borrowed help and imagery, and made his own
creations more his own than otherwise they would have been.</p>

<p class='c000'>And 3rd. To the great Brotherhood of nations among the
Teutonic race, to whom Shakespeare is known as a chieftain
among the Lares,—the heroes and guardians of their households.
In him they recognise an impersonation of high poetic
Art, and they desire to see unrolled from the treasures of the
past whatever course his genius pursued to elevate and refine
its powers;—persuaded that out of the elevation and refinement
ever is springing something of his own inspiration to improve
and ennoble mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>A word or two may be allowed respecting the translations
into English which are offered of the Emblem writers’ verses
occurring in the quotations. An accurate rendering of the original
was desirable; and, therefore, in many instances, rhymes
and strictly measured lines have been abjured, and cadence
trusted rather than metre; the defect of the plan, perhaps, is
that cadence varies with the peculiar pitch and intonation of
each person’s voice. Nevertheless, among rhymes the <cite>Oarsman’s
Cry</cite> (p. 61) might find a place on Cam, or Isis, and the <cite>Wolf
and the Ass</cite> (p. 54) be entitled to abide in a book of fables.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='xii' id='Page_xii'></span>In behalf of quotations from the original, it is to be urged
that, to defamiliarise the minds of the public, so much as is now
the custom, from the sight of other languages than their own, is
injurious to the maintenance of scholarship; and were it not so,
the works quoted from are many of them not in general use,
and some are of highest rarity;—it is, therefore, only simple
justice to the reader to place before him the original on the very
page he is reading.</p>

<p class='c007'>The value of the work will doubtless be increased by the
Appendices and the very full Index which have been added.
These will enable such as are inclined more thoroughly to
compare together the different parts of the work, and better to
judge of it, and to pursue its subjects elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>My offering I hang up where many brighter garlands have
been placed,—and where, as generations pass away, many more
will be brought; it is at his shrine whose genius consecrated
the English tongue to some of the highest purposes of which
speech is capable. For Humanity itself he rendered his Service
of Song a guidance to that which is noble as well as beautiful,—a
sympathy with our nature as well as a truth for our souls.
God’s benison rest upon his memory!</p>

WHAT Emblems are, in the general acceptation
of the word in modern times, is well
set forth in Cotgrave’s <cite>Dictionary</cite>, Art.
<span class='sc'>Emblema</span>, where he defines an emblem to
be, “a picture and short posie, expressing some particular
conceit;” and very pithily by Francis Quarles, when he says,—“an
Emblem is but a silent Parable.” Though less terse and
clear than either of these, we may also take Bacon’s description,
in his <cite>Advancement of Learning</cite>, bk. v. chap. 5;—“<em>Embleme</em>
deduceth conceptions intellectuall to images sensible, and that
which is sensible more forcibly strikes the memory, and is more
easily imprinted than that which is intellectual.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By many writers of Emblem books, perhaps by the majority
in their practice if not in their theories, there is very little
difference of meaning observed between Symbols and Emblems.
We find, however, in other Authors a more exact usage of the
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>word Symbol. The Greek poet Pindar<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> speaks of “a trustworthy
symbol, or sign, concerning a future action,” or from
which the future can be conjectured; Iago, recounting the
power of Desdemona over Othello, act ii. scene 3, l. 326,
declares it were easy</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in35'>“for her</div>
      <div class='line'>To win the Moor, were’t to renounce his baptism,</div>
      <div class='line'>All seals and symbols of redeemed sin;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and Cudworth, in his <cite>True Intellectual System of the Universe</cite>,
ed. 1678, p. 388, after giving Aristotle’s assertion “<em>that
Numbers were the Causes of the Essence of other things</em>,”
adds, “though we are not ignorant, how the Pythagoreans
made also the Numbers within the Decad, to be Symbols of
things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Claude Marginality, or Minōs, the famous commentator on
the Emblems of Andreas Alciatus, in his Tract, <cite>Concerning
Symbols, Coats of Arms, and Emblems</cite>,—eds. 1581, or 1608, or
1614,—maintains there is a clear distinction between emblems
and symbols, which, as he affirms, “many persons rashly and
ignorantly confound together.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> “We confess,” he adds, “that
the force of the Emblem depends upon the Symbol: but they
differ, I say, as Man and Animal; for people who have any
judgment at all know, that here of a certainty the latter is taken
more generally, the former more specially.” Mignault’s meaning
may be carried out by saying, that all men are animals,—but
all animals are not men; so all emblems are symbols,
tokens, or signs, but all symbols are not emblems;—the two
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>possess affinity but not identity,—they have no absolute convertibility
of the one for the other.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>The word emblem, ἐμβλημα, is one that has strayed very
widely from its first meaning, and yet by a sort of natural
process, as the apple grows out of the crab, its signification now
is akin to what it was in distant ages. It then denoted the
thing, whether implement or ornament, placed in, or thrown on,
and so joined to, some other thing. Thus a word of cognate
origin, <em>Epiblēs</em>, in the <cite>Iliad</cite>, bk. xxiv. l. 453,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> denoted the bolt
of fir that held fast the door;—it was something put against the
door,—the peg or bar that kept it from opening. So in the
<cite>Odyssey</cite>, bk. ii. l. 37,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> the sceptre, the emblem of command,
was the baton which the herald Peisēnor <em>placed in</em> the hand of
the son of Ulysses; and again in the <cite>Iliad</cite>, bk. xiii. l. 319, 20,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
the flaming torch was the implement which the son of Kronos
might <em>throw on</em> the swift ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the changes through which a word may pass, “the word
Emblem presents one of the most remarkable instances.” They
cannot be better given than in the “<cite>Sketch of that branch of
Literature called</cite> <span class='sc'>Books of Emblems</span>,” read in 1848 before
the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, by the late
Joseph Brooks Yates, Esq. He says of the word <span class='sc'>Emblem</span>,
pp. 8, 9,—“its present signification, ‘Type or allusive representation,’
is of comparatively modern use, while its original
meaning is become obsolete. Among the Greeks an Emblem
(εμβλημα), derived from ενβαλλειν, meant something thrown in or
inserted after the fashion of what we now call Marquetry and
Mosaic work, or in the form of a detached ornament to be affixed
to a pillar, a tablet, or a vase, and put off or on, as there might
be occasion. Pliny, in his <cite>Natural History</cite>,” bk. xxxiii. c. 12,
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>“mentions an artist called Pytheus, who executed works of this
last description in silver, one of which, intended to be attached
to a jar (in phialæ emblemate), represented Ulysses and Diomed
carrying off the Palladium.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> It weighed two ounces, and sold
for 10,000 sesterces = 80<em>l</em>. 14<em>s</em>. 7<em>d</em>. of our money. According to
one ancient manuscript of Pliny, it sold for double that amount.
Marcus Curtius leaping into the gulph forms the subject of a
beautiful silver Emblem, in the possession of the writer.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> When
the arts of Greece were transplanted into Italy and Sicily, the
word <em>Emblema</em> became naturalised in the Latin tongue, though
not without some resistance on the part of the reigning prince
Tiberius. That emperor is reported by Suetonius,” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Tiber. Cæsar
Vita</cite></span>, c. 71, “to have found fault with the introduction of the
word into a Decree of the Senate, as being of foreign growth.
Cicero, however, had used it in his orations against Verres, where
he accuses that rapacious governor (amongst other crimes) of
having compelled the people of Haluntium to bring to him their
vases, from which he carefully abstracted the valuable Emblems
and inserted them upon his own golden vessels. Quintilian,”
lib. 2, cap. 4, “soon after this period, in enumerating the arts of
oratory used by the pleaders of his day, describes some of them
as in the habit of preparing and committing to memory certain
highly finished clauses, to be inserted (as occasion might arise)
<em>like Emblems</em> in the body of their orations.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Such was the meaning of the term in the classical ages of
Greece and Rome; nor was its signification altered until some
time after the revival of literature in the fifteenth century.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Our own Geoffrey Whitney, deriving, as he does the other
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>parts of his <cite>Choice of Emblemes</cite> from the writers on the subject
that preceded him, gives very exactly the same explanation as
Mr. Yates. In his address “To the Reader” (p. 2) he says;—“It
resteth now to shewe breeflie what this worde Embleme
signifieth, and whereof it commeth, which thoughe it be borrowed
of others, &amp; not proper in the Englishe tonge, yet that
which it signifieth: Is, and hathe bin alwaies in vse amongst vs,
which worde being in Greek ἐμβάλλεσθαι, vel ἐπεμβλῆσθαι is as
muche to saye in Englishe as <em>To set in, or to put in</em>: properlie
ment by suche figures, or workes; as are wroughte in plate, or in
stones in the pauementes, or on the waules, or suche like, for the
adorning of the place: hauinge some wittie deuise expressed
with cunning woorkemanship, somethinge obscure to be perceiued
at the first, whereby, when with further consideration it is
vnderstood, it maie the greater delighte the behoulder. And
althoughe the worde dothe comprehende manie thinges, and
diuers matters maie be therein contained; yet all Emblemes for
the most parte, maie be reduced into these three kindes, which
is <em>Historicall</em>, <em>Naturall</em>, &amp; <em>Morall</em>. <em>Historicall</em>, as representing
the actes of some noble persons, being matter of historie. <em>Naturall</em>,
as in expressing the natures of creatures, for example, the
loue of the yonge Storkes, to the oulde, or of suche like. <em>Morall</em>,
pertaining to vertue and instruction of life, which is the chiefe of
the three, and the other two maye bee in some sorte drawen into
this head. For, all doe tende vnto discipline, and morall preceptes
of liuing. I mighte write more at large hereof, and of the
difference of <em>Emblema</em>, <em>Symbolum</em>, <em>&amp; Ænigma</em>, hauinge all (as it
weare) some affinitie one with the other. But bicause my meaning
is to write as briefely as I maie, for the auoiding of tediousnes,
I referre them that would further inquire therof, to <em>And.
Alciatus</em>, <em>Guiliel. Perrerius</em>, <em>Achilles Bocchius</em> &amp; to diuers others
that haue written thereof, wel knowne to the learned. For I
purpose at this present, to write onelie of this worde Embleme:
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>Bicause it chieflie doth pertaine vnto the matter I haue in hande,
whereof I hope this muche, shall giue them some taste that
weare ignoraunt of the same.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Whitney’s namesake, to whom flattering friendship compared
him, Geoffrey Chaucer, gives us more than the touch of an
Emblem, when he describes, in the <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>, l. 159–63,
the dress of “a Nonne, a Prioresse,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Of smale corall aboute hire arm she bare</div>
      <div class='line'>A pair of bedes, gauded all with grene;</div>
      <div class='line'>And theron heng a broche of gold ful shene,</div>
      <div class='line'>On whiche was first ywritten a crouned A,</div>
      <div class='line'>And after, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Amor vincit omnia</em></span>.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>So the “Cristofre,” which the Yeoman wore, l. 115,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>was doubtless a true Emblem, to be put on, and taken off, as
occasion served,—and was probably a cross with the image of
Christ upon it: and if pictured forth according to the description
in <cite>The Legend of Good Women</cite>, l. 1196–8, an emblematical device
was exhibited, where</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With saddle redde, embrouded with delite</div>
      <div class='line'>Of gold the barres, up enbossed high,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sate Dido, all in gold and perrie wrigh.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This form, the natural form of the Emblem, we may illustrate
from a Greek coin, figured in Eschenburg’s <cite>Manual of Classical
Literature</cite>, by Fisk, ed. 1844, pl. xl. p. 351.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Flying Horse and other ornaments of this coin on the
helmet of Minerva are Emblems,—and so are the owl, the
olive wreath, and the amphora, or two-handled vase. Were these
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>independent castings or mouldings, to be put on or taken off,
they would be veritable emblems in the strict literal sense of
the word.</p>

<div id='i012'  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/img012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Spenser’s ideas of devices and ornaments correspond to this
meaning. Mercilla, the allegorical representation of the sovereign
Elizabeth, is described as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>“that gratious Queene:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Who sate on high, that she might all men see</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And might of all men royally be seene,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Upon a throne of gold full bright and sheene,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Adorned all with gemmes of endless price,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>As either might for wealth have gotten beene,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Or could be fram’d by workman’s rare device</div>
      <div class='line'>And all embost with lyons and with flour de lice.”</div>
      <div class='c017'>                           <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>, v. 9. 27.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Cymbeline</cite>, Shakespeare represents Iachimo, act i. sc. 6,
l. 188, 9, describing “a present for the emperor;”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“Tis plate, of rare device; and jewels</div>
      <div class='line'>Of rich and exquisite form; their values great.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>So Spenser, <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>, iv. 4. 15, sets forth, “a precious
rebeke in an arke of gold,” as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A gorgeous Girdle, curiously embost</div>
      <div class='line'>With pearle and precious stone, worth many a marke;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet did the workmanship farre passe the cost.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>In the literal use of the word emblem Shakespeare is very
exact. Parolles, <cite>All’s Well</cite>, act ii. sc. 1, l. 40, charges the
young lords of the French court, as</p>

<p class='c018'>“Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin;” and adds, “Good sparks
and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of the
Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his
sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrenched it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Coronation Scene in <cite>Henry VIII</cite>., act iv. sc. 1. l. 81–92,
describes the solemnities, when Anne Bullen, “the goodliest
woman that ever lay by man,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>“with modest paces</div>
      <div class='line'>Came to the altar; where she kneel’d, and saint-like</div>
      <div class='line'>Cast her fair eyes to heaven, and pray’d devoutly:”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Each sacred rite is then observed towards her;—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She had all the royal makings of a queen;</div>
      <div class='line'>As holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,</div>
      <div class='line'>The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems</div>
      <div class='line'>Lay’d nobly on her.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And down to Milton’s time the original meaning of the word
Emblem was still retained, though widely departed from as used
by some of the Emblem writers. Thus he pictures the “blissful
bower” of Eden, bk. iv. l. 697–703, <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>“each beauteous flower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Iris all hues, roses, and jessamin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rear’d high their flourish’d heads between, and wrought</div>
      <div class='line'>Mosaic: underfoot the violet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay</div>
      <div class='line'>Broider’d the ground, more colour’d than with stone</div>
      <div class='line'>Of costliest emblem.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus, in their origin, Emblems were the figures or ornaments
fashioned by the tools of the artists, in metal or wood, independent
of the vase, or the column, or the furniture, they were intended
to adorn; they might be affixed or detached at the
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>promptings of the owner’s fancy. Then they were formed, as in
mosaic, by placing side by side little blocks of coloured stone, or
tiles, or small sections of variegated wood. Raised or carved
figures, however produced, came next to be considered as
Emblems; and afterwards any kind of figured ornament, or
device, whether carved or engraved, or simply traced, on the
walls and floors of houses or on vessels of wood, clay, stone, or
metal. These ornaments were sometimes like the raised work
on the Warwick and other vases, and formed a <em>crust</em> which
made a part of the vessel which they embellished; but at other
times they were devices, drawings and carvings on a <em>framework</em>
which might be detached from the cup or goblet on which the
owner had placed them, and be applied to other uses.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We may here remark, since embossed ornaments and sculptured
figures on any plain surface are essentially Emblems, the
sculptor, the engraver, the statuary and the architect, indeed all
workers in wood, metal, or stone, who embellish with device or
symbol the simplicity of nature’s materials, are especially entitled
to take rank in the fraternity of the Emblematists. They
and their patrons, the whole world of the civilized and the
intellectual, are not content with the beam out of the forest, or
with the marble from the quarry, or with even the gold from the
mine. In themselves cedar, marble and gold are only forms of
brute and unintelligent nature,—and therefore we impose upon
them signs of deep-seated thoughts of the heart and devices of
wondrous meaning, and out of the rocks call forth sermons,
and lessons and parables, and highly spiritual suggestions. On
the very shrines of God we place our images of corruptible
things,—but then the soul that rightly reads the images lifts
them out of their corruptibility and makes them the teachers of
eternal truths.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>The domains of the statuary and of the architect are however
too vast to be entered upon by us, except with a passing
glance; they are like Philosophy; it is all <em>Natural</em>,—and yet
wisely men map it out into kingdoms and divisions, and pursue
each his selected work.</p>

<p class='c000'>So we remember it is not the Universe of Emblematism we
must attempt, even though Shakespeare should lend us</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>To</em> glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</div>
      <div class='line'>And as imagination bodies forth</div>
      <div class='line'>The forms of things unknown,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>should add the gift of “the poet’s pen,” so that we might</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Turn them to shapes, and give to airy nothing</div>
      <div class='line'>A local habitation and a name.”</div>
      <div class='c017'><cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>, act v. sc. 1. l. 12–17.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Our business is only with that comparatively small section of
the Emblem-World, which, “like mummies in their cerements,”
is wrapped up within the covers of the so called Emblem-books.
Whether, when they are unrolled, they are worth the search and
the labour, some may doubt;—but perchance a scarabæus, or an
emerald, with an ancient harp upon it, may reward our patience.</p>

<p class='c007'>By a very easy and natural step, figures and ornaments of
many kinds, when placed on smooth surfaces, were named
emblems; and as these figures and ornaments were very often
symbolical, <em>i. e.</em>, signs, or tokens of a thought, a sentiment, a
saying, or an event, the term emblem was applied to any painting,
drawing, or print that was representative of an action, of a
quality of the mind, or of any peculiarity or attribute of character.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
“Emblems in fact were, and are, a species of hieroglyphics,
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>in which the figures or pictures, besides denoting the
natural objects to which they bear resemblances, were employed
to express properties of the mind, virtues and abstract ideas, and
all the operations of the soul.”</p>

<p><em>Tableau of Human Life from Cebes B C 390</em></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus, the <cite>Tablet of Cebes</cite>, a work by one of the disciples of
Socrates, about B.C. 390, is an explanation, in the form of a
Dialogue, of a picture, said to have been set up in the temple
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>of Kronos at Athens or at Thebes, and which was declared to be
emblematical of Human Life.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the older Latin versions, printed in 1507, presents the
foregoing illustrative frontispiece.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the book has come down to modern times it is, generally,
what has sometimes been named, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>nudum Emblema</em></span>, a naked
Emblem, because it has neither device nor artistic drawing, but,
like Shakespeare’s comparison of all the world to a stage in which
man plays many parts, the course of Life, with its discipline, false
hopes and false pleasures, is in the Tablet so described,—in
fact so delineated,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> as to have enabled the Dutch designer and
engraver, Romyn de Hooghe, in 1670, to have pictured “the
whole story of Human Life as narrated to the Grecian sage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Moral of the Allegory may not be set forth with entire
clearness in the picture, but it can be given in the words of one of
the <cite>Golden Sentences</cite> of Democritus,—see Gale’s <cite>Opus. Mythol.</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“That human happiness does not result from bodily excellencies nor from
riches, but is founded on uprightness of mind and on righteousness of
conduct.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Coins and medals furnish most valuable examples of emblematical
figures; indeed some of the Emblem writers, as Sambucus
in 1564, were among the earliest to publish impressions
or engravings of ancient Roman money, on which are frequently
given very interesting representations of customs and symbolical
acts. On Grecian coins, which Priestley, in his <cite>Lectures on History</cite>,
vol. i. p. 126,—highly praises for “a design, an attitude,
a force, and a delicacy, in the expression even of the muscles
and veins of human figures,”—we find, to use heraldic language,
that the owl is the crest of Athens,—a wolf’s head, that of
Argos,—and a tortoise the badge of the Peloponnesus. The
whole history of Louis XIV. and that of his great adversary,
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>William III., are represented in volumes containing the medals
that were struck to commemorate the leading events of their
reigns, and though outrageously untrue to nature and reality by
the adoption of Roman costumes and classic symbols, they serve
as records of remarkable occurrences.</p>

<p class='c000'>Heraldry throughout employs the language of Emblems;—it
is the picture-history of families, of tribes and of nations, of
princes and emperors. Many a legend and many a strange
fancy may be mixed up with it and demand almost the credulity
of simplest childhood in order to obtain our credence; yet in the
literature of Chivalry and Honours there are enshrined abundant
records of the glory that belonged to mighty names. I recall
now but one instance. In the fine folio lately emblazoned with
the well-known motto “<span class='fss'>GANG FORWARD</span>,” “<span class='fss'>I AM READY</span>,” what
volumes, to those who can interpret each mark and sign and
tutored symbol, are wrapped up in the <cite>Examples of the ornamental
Heraldry of the sixteenth Century</cite>: London, 1867, 1868.</p>

<p class='c000'>The custom of taking a device or badge, if not a motto, is
traced by Paolo Giovio, in his <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Dialogo dell’ Imprese militari et
amorose</cite></span>, ed. 1574, p. 9,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> to the earliest times of history. He
writes,</p>

<p class='c018'>“To bear these emblems was an ancient usage.” <span class='sc'>Gio.</span> “It is a point not
to be doubted, that the ancients used to bear crests and ornaments on the
helmets and on the shields: for we see this clearly in Virgil, when he made
the catalogue of the nations which came in favour of Turnus against the
Trojans, in the eighth book of the Æneid; Amphiaraus then (as Pindar
says) at the war of Thebes bore a dragon on his shield. Similarly Statius
writes of Capaneus and of Polinices, that the one bore the Hydra, and the
other the Sphynx,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>But these were simple emblems, without motto inscribed.
The same Paolo Giovio, and other writers after him,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a> assign both
“picture and short posie,” to two of the early Emperors of Rome.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Augustus, wishing to show how self-governed and moderate he was in
all his affairs, never rash and hasty to believe the first reports and informations
of his servants, caused to be struck, among several others, on a gold medal of
his own, a Butterfly and a Crab, signifying quickness by the Butterfly, and
by the Crab slowness, the two things which constitute a temperament
necessary for a Prince.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The motto, as figured below,—“<span class='sc'>Make haste leisurely</span>.”</p>

adopted, with the motto “<span class='sc'>Propera tarde</span>,”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> <em>Hasten slowly</em>:
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>facendo</em>,</span>” says Symeoni, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<em>vna figura moderata della velocità di
questo, e della grauezza di quell’ altra, nel modo che noi veggiamo
dinanzi à i libri d’ Aldo</em>.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>But the heraldry of mankind is a boundless theme, and we
might by simple beat of drum heraldic collect almost a countless
host of crests, badges, and quarterings truly emblematical, and
adopted and intended to point out peculiarities or remarkable
events and fancies in the histories of the coat-armour families of
the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>The emblematism of bodily sign or action constitutes the
language of the dumb. An amusing instance occurs in the
Abbé Blanchet’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Apologues Orientaux</span>,”</span> in his description
of “<em>The Silent Academy, or the Emblems</em>:”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“There was at Hamadan, a city of Persia, a celebrated academy, of which
the first statute was conceived in these terms; <em>The academicians shall think
much, write little, and speak the very least that is possible.</em> It was named
<em>the silent Academy</em>; and there was not in Persia any truly learned man who
had not the ambition of being admitted to it. Dr. Zeb, an imaginary person,
author of an excellent little work, <span class='sc'>The Gag</span>, learned, in the retirement of
the province where he was born, there was one place vacant in the silent
Academy. He sets out immediately; he arrives at Hamadan, and presenting
himself at the door of the hall where the academicians are assembled, he
prays the servant to give this billet to the president: <em>Dr. Zeb asks humbly
the vacant place.</em> The servant immediately executed the commission, but
the Doctor and his billet arrived too late,—the place was already filled.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The Academy was deeply grieved at this disappointment; it had
admitted, a little against its wish, a wit from the court, whose lively light
eloquence formed the admiration of all <em>ruelles</em>.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a> The Academy saw itself
reduced to refuse Doctor Zeb, the scourge of praters, with a head so well
formed and so well furnished! The president, charged to announce to
the Doctor the disagreeable news, could scarcely bring himself to it, and
knew not how to do it. After having thought a little, he filled a large cup
with water, but so well filled it, that one drop more would have made the
liquid overflow; then he made sign that the candidate should be introduced.
He appeared with that simple and modest air which almost always
announces true merit. The president arose and, without offering a single
word, showed, with an appearance of deep sorrow, the emblematic cup,
this cup so exactly filled. The Doctor understood that there was no more
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>room in the Academy; but without losing courage, he thought how to
make it understood that one supernumerary academician would disarrange
nothing. He sees at his feet a roseleaf, he picks it up, he places it gently on
the surface of the water, and did it so well that not a single drop escaped.</p>

<p class='c019'>“At this ingenious answer everybody clapped hands; the rules were
allowed to sleep for this day, and Doctor Zeb was received by acclamation.
The register of the Academy was immediately presented to him, where the
new members must inscribe themselves. He then inscribed himself in it;
and there remained for him no more than to pronounce, according to custom,
a phrase of thanks. But as a truly silent academician, Doctor Zeb returned
thanks without saying a word. He wrote in the margin the number 100,—it
was that of his new brethren; then, by putting a 0 before the figures, 0100,
he wrote below, <em>they are worth neither less nor more</em>. The president
answered the modest Doctor with as much politeness as presence of mind.
He placed the figure 1 before the number 100, <em>i.e.</em> 1100; and he wrote, <em>they
will be worth eleven times more</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The varieties in the Emblems which exist might be pursued
from “the bird, the mouse, the frog, and the four arrows,” which,
the Father of history tells us,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a> the Scythians sent to Darius, the
invader of their country,—through all the ingenious devices by
which the initiated in secret societies, whether political, social, or
religious, seek to guard their mysteries from general knowledge
and observation,—until we come to the flower-language of the
affections, and learn to read, as Hindoo and Persian maidens
can, the telegrams of buds and blossoms,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and to interpret the
flashing of colours, either simple or combined. We should have
to name the Picture writing of the Mexicans, and to declare
what meanings lie concealed in the signs and imagery which
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>adorn tomb and monument,—or peradventure to set forth the
art by which, on so simple a material as the bark of a birch-tree,
some Indians, on their journey, emblematized a troop with
attendants that had lost their way. “In the party there was
a military officer, a person whom the Indians understood
to be an attorney, and a mineralogist; eight were armed:
when they halted they made three encampments.” With
their knives the Indians traced these particulars on the bark
by means of certain signs, or, rather, hieroglyphical marks;—“a
man with a sword,” they fashioned “for the officer;
another with a book for the lawyer, and a third with a
hammer for the mineralogist; three ascending columns of
smoke denoted the three encampments, and eight muskets
the number of armed men.” So, without paper or print, a
not unintelligible memorial was left of the company that were
travelling together.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so we come to the very Early Examples—if not the
earliest—of Emblematical Representation, as exhibited in fictile
remains, in the workmanship of the silversmith, and of those by
whom the various metals and precious stones have been wrought
and moulded; and especially in the numerous specimens of the
skill or of the fancy which the glyptic and other artizans of
ancient Egypt have left for modern times.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the nature of Fictile ornamentation it were sufficient to
refer to the recently published <cite>Life of Josiah Wedgwood</cite>;<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a> but
in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>antefixæ</em></span>, or terra cotta ornaments, derived from the old
Etruscan civilisation, we possess true and literal Emblems. As
the name implies, these ornaments “were <em>fixed before the buildings</em>,”
often on the friezes “which they adorned,” and were
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>fastened to them by leaden nails. For examples, easy of access,
we refer to the sketches supplied by James Yates, Esq., of
Highgate; to the <cite>Dictionary of Gk. and Rom. Antiquities</cite>, p. 51;
and especially to that antefixa which represents Minerva superintending
the construction of the ship Argo. The man with the
hammer and chisel is Argus, who built the vessel under her
direction. The pilot Tiphys is assisted by her in attaching the
sail to the yard. The borders at the top and bottom are in the
Greek style, and are extremely elegant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And the pressing of clay into a matrix or mould, from which
the form is taken, appears to be of very ancient date. The book
of Job xxxviii. 14, alludes to the practice in the words, “it is
turned as clay to the seal.” Of similar or of higher antiquity is
“the work of an engraver in stone, <em>like</em> the engravings of a
signet,” Exodus xxviii. 11. And “the breastplate of judgment,
the Urim and the Thummim,” v. 30, worn “upon Aaron’s
heart,” was probably a similar emblematical ornament to that
which Diodorus Siculus, in his <cite>History</cite>, bk. i. chap. 75, tells us
was put on by the president of the Egyptian courts of justice:
“He bore about his neck a golden chain, at which hung an
image, set about, or composed of precious stones, which was
called <span class='sc'>Truth</span>.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among instances of emblematical workmanship by the silversmith
and his confabricators of similar crafts, we may name that
shield of Achilles which Homer so graphically describes,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> “solid
and large,” “decorated with numerous figures of most skilful
art;”—or the shields of Hercules and of Æneas, with which
Hesiod, <cite>Eoeæ</cite>, iv. 141–317, and Virgil, <cite>Æneid</cite>, viii. 615–73,
might make us familiar. Or to come to modern times,—to days
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>our very own,—there is the still more precious, the matchless
shield by Vehm, whereon, in most expressive imagery, are hammered
out the discoveries of Newton, Milton’s noble epics, and
Shakespeare’s dramatic wonders. We may, too, in passing,
allude to the richly-embossed and ornamented cups for which
our swift racers and grey-hounds, and those “dogs of war,” our
volunteers, contend; and the almost imperial pieces of plate,
such as the Cæsars never beheld, in which genius and the highest
art combine, by their “cunning work,” to carve the deeds and
enhance the renown of some of our great Indian administrators
and illustrious generals; these all, truly “choice emblemes,”
intimate the extent to which our subject might lead. But I
forbear to pursue it, though scarcely any path offers greater
temptations for wandering abroad amid the marvels of human
skill, and for considering reverently and gladly how men have
been “filled with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding,
and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship.”
Exodus xxxi. 3.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of glyptic art the most ancient, as well as the most ample,
remains are found in the temples and the other monuments of
Egypt. Various modern explorers and writers have given very
elaborate accounts of those remains, and still are carrying on
their researches; but of old writers only Clemens, of Alexandria,
who flourished “towards the end of the second century after
Christ,” “has left us a full and correct account of the principle
of the Egyptian writing,”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a> and has declared what the subjects
were which were included in the word hieroglyphics;<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> and as
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>far as is known, no other early author, except Horapollo of the
Nile, has written expressly on the Hieroglyphics of Egypt, and
declared that his work—which was probably translated into
Greek in the reign of the emperor Zeno, or even later—was
derived from Egyptian sources; indeed, was a book in the
language of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably the best account we have of the author and of
the translator, is given by Alexander Turner Cory, in the
Preface to his edition of Horapollo. He says, pp. viii.
and ix.,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“At the beginning of the fifth century, Horapollo, a scribe of the Egyptian
race, and a native of Phœnebythis, attempted to collect and perpetuate in
the volume before us, the then remaining, but fast fading knowledge of the
symbols inscribed upon the monuments, which attested the ancient grandeur
of his country. This compilation was originally made in the Egyptian language;
but a translation of it into Greek by Philip has alone come down to
us, and in a condition very far from satisfactory. From the internal evidence
of the work, we should judge Philip to have lived a century or two later than
Horapollo; and at a time when every remnant of actual knowledge of the
subject must have vanished.”</p>

<p class='c000'>However this may be, it is certainly a book of Emblems, and
just previous to Shakespeare’s age, and during its continuance
was regarded as a high authority. Within that time there were
at least five editions of the work,—and it was certainly the mine
in which the writers of Emblem books generally sought for what
were to them valuable suggestions. The edition we have used is
the small octavo of 1551,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a> with many woodcuts, imaginative
indeed, but designed in accordance with the original text. J.
Mercier, a distinguished scholar, who died in 1562, was the
editor. In 1547 he was professor of Hebrew at the Royal
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>College of Paris, and in 1548 edited the quarto edition of
Horapollo’s <cite>Hieroglyphics</cite>.</p>

<div  class='figright id009'>
<img src='images/img017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Horapollo, 1551.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>From the edition of 1551, p. 52, we take a very popular
illustration; it is the Phœnix, and may serve to show the nature
of Horapollo’s work.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How,” he asks, “do
the Egyptians represent
a soul passing a long
time here?” “They
paint a bird—the Phœnix;
for of all creatures
in the world this bird has
by far the longest life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, bk. i. 37, or
p. 53, “How do they denote
the man who after
long absence will return to his friends from abroad?” By the
Phœnix; “for this bird, after five hundred years, when the
death hour is about to seize it, returns to Egypt, and in
Egypt, paying the debt of nature, is burned with great
solemnity. And whatever sacred rites the Egyptians observe
towards their other sacred animals, these they observe towards
the Phœnix.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And bk. ii. 57,—“The lasting restoration which shall take
place after long ages, when they wish to signify it, they paint
the bird Phœnix. For when it is born this bird obtains the
restoration of its properties. And its birth is in this manner:
the Phœnix being about to die, dashes itself upon the ground,
and receiving a wound, ichor flows from it, and through the
opening another Phœnix is born. And when its wings are
fledged, this other sets out with its father to the city of the
Sun in Egypt, and on arriving there, at the rising of the
Sun, the parent dies; and after the death of the father, the
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>young one sets out again for its own country. And the dead
Phœnix do the priests of Egypt bury.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the drawings, which in the old editions of Horapollo
were fancy-made, have, through the researches of a succession of
Egyptian antiquaries, assumed reality, and may be appealed to
for proof that Horapollo described the very things which he had
seen, though occasionally he, or his translator Philip, attributes
to them an imaginative or highly mythical meaning. The
results of those researches we witness in the editions of Horapollo,
first by the celebrated Dr. Conrad Leemans, of Leyden,
in 1835,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and second, by Alexander Turner Cory, Fellow of
Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1840;<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a> both of which editions,
by their illustrative plates, taken from correct drawings of the
originals, present Horapollo with an accuracy that could not
have been approached in the sixteenth century. We have
indeed of that age the great work of Pierius Valerian (ed. folio,
Bâle, 1556, leaves 449), the <cite>Hieroglyphica</cite>, dedicated to Cosmo
de’ Medici, with almost innumerable emblems, in fifty-eight
books, and with about 365 devices. But it cannot be regarded
as an exposition of the Egyptian art, and labours under the
same defect as the early editions of Horapollo,—the illustrations
are not taken from existing monuments.</p>

<p class='c000'>An example or two from Leemans and Cory will supply
sufficient information to enable the reader to understand
something of the nature of Horapollo’s work, and of the actual
Hieroglyphics from which that work has in great part been
verified.</p>

<div  class='figright id015'>
<img src='images/img018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Leemans’ Horapollo, 1835.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The following is the 31st figure in the plates which Leemans
gives; it is the pictorial representation to explain “What
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>the Egyptians mean when they engrave or paint a star.”<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
“Would they signify the God who sets in order the world, or
destiny, or the number
five, they paint a star;
God, indeed, because the
providence of God, to
which the motion of the
stars and of all the world
is subject, determines
the victory; for it seems
to them that, apart from
God, nothing whatever could endure; and destiny <em>they signify</em>,
since this also is regulated by stellar management,—and the
number five, because out of the multitude which is in heaven,
five only, by motion originating from themselves, make perfect
the management of the world.”</p>

<div  class='figright id016'>
<img src='images/img019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Of the three figures which are delineated above, the one to
the left hand symbolizes God, that in the middle destiny,
and the third, the number 5, from five rays being used to
indicate a star.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same subjects are
thus represented in Cory’s
Horapollo.</p>

<div id='i020'  class='figleft id017'>
<img src='images/img020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Cory’s Horapollo, 1840.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Cory’s Horapollo, bk. i.
c. 8, p. 15, also illustrates
the question, “How do they
indicate the soul?” by the accompanying symbols; of which
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span><span class='fss'>I</span>. represents the mummy and the departing soul, <span class='fss'>II</span>. the hawk
found sitting on the mummy, and <span class='fss'>III</span>. the external mummy
case. The answer
to the question
is:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Moreover, the
<span class='sc'>Hawk</span> is put for
the soul, from the
signification of its
name; for among
the Egyptians the
hawk is called
<span class='sc'>Baieth</span>: and this name in decomposition signifies soul and heart; for the
word <span class='sc'>Bai</span> is the soul, and <span class='fss'>ETH</span> the heart: and the heart according to the
Egyptians is the shrine of the soul; so that in its composition the name
signifies ‘soul enshrined in heart.’ Whence also the hawk, from its correspondence
with the soul, never drinks water, but blood, by which, also, the
soul is sustained.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And in a similar way many of the sacred engravings or drawings
are interpreted. A serpent with its tail covered by the rest
of its body, “depicts Eternity;”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a> “to denote an <em>only begotten</em>, or
<em>generation</em>, or a <em>father</em>, or the <em>world</em>, or a <em>man</em>, they delineate a
<span class='fss'>SCARABÆUS</span>;”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a> a <span class='sc'>Lion</span> symbolises <em>intrepidity</em>,—its <span class='fss'>FOREPARTS</span>,
<em>strength</em>, and its <span class='fss'>HEAD</span>, <em>watchfulness</em>;<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a> the <span class='sc'>Stork</span> denotes
<em>filial affection</em>, the <span class='sc'>Crane</span> on the watch, a man on guard against
his enemies, and the <span class='fss'>FEATHER</span> of an Ostrich, <em>impartial justice</em>,—for,
adds the author, “this animal, beyond other animals, has
the wing feathers equal on every side.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Christian Art, like the Religious Art of the world in general,—from
the <em>thou</em> and <em>thee</em> of simplest Quakerism, outward and
audible sounds of an inward and silent spirit, up to the profoundest
mystic ritualism of the Buddhist,—Christian Art
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>abounds in Emblems; gems and colours, genuflexions and other
bodily postures supply them; they are gathered from the mineral,
animal, and vegetable kingdoms, and besides are enriched from
the whole domain of imaginary devices and creatures. Does
the emerald flash in its mild lustre?—it is of “victory and hope,
of immortality, of faith, and of reciprocal love,” that it gives
forth light. Is blue, the colour of heaven, worn in some religious
ceremony?—it betokens “piety, sincerity, godliness, contemplation,
expectation, love of heavenly things.” Do Christian
men bare the head in worship?—it is out of reverence for the
living God, whose earthly temples they have entered. The
badge of St. John the Baptist, is a lamb on a book,—that of St.
John the Evangelist is a cup of gold with a serpent issuing from
it. The Pomegranate, “showing its fulness of seed and now
bursting,” typifies the hope of immortality;—and a Fleur-de-lys,
or the Rose of Sharon, embroidered or painted on a robe,—it
marks the Blessed Virgin. With more intricate symbolism
the Greek Church represents the Saviour’s name <b><span class='large'>Ι</span>HϹΟΥ<span class='large'>Ϲ</span>
<span class='large'>Χ</span>ΡΙϹΤΟ<span class='large'>Ϲ</span></b>.—IesuS CHristuS. The first finger of the hand extended
is for I, the second bent for <b>C</b> or s, the thumb crossed
upon the third finger for <b>Χ</b> or Ch, and the fourth finger curved
for <b>Ϲ</b> or s. Thus are given the initial and final letters of that
Holy Name, the Saviour, the Christ.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of early Emblems examples enough have now been given to
indicate their nature. Whether in closing this part of the
subject we should name a work of more ancient date even than
the Greek version of Horapollo would admit of doubt, were it
not that every work partakes of an emblematical character,
when the descriptions given or the instances taken pertain, as</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>Whitney says, “to vertue and instruction of life,” or “doe tende
vnto discipline, and morall preceptes of living.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Under this rule we hesitate not to admit into the wide category
of Emblem writers, <span class='sc'>Epiphanius</span>, who was chosen bishop of
Constantia in Cyprus, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 367, and who died in 402. His
<cite>Physiologist</cite>, published with his sermon on the Feast of Palms,
is, like many writings of the Fathers, remarkable for highly
allegorical interpretations. An edition, by Ponce de Leon, a
Spaniard of Seville, was printed at Rome in 1587, and repeated
at Antwerp<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a> in 1588. It relates to the real and imaginary
qualities of animals, and to certain precepts and doctrines of
which those qualities are supposed to be symbolical. As an
example we give here an extract from chapter <span class='fss'>XXV</span>. p. 106,
“<cite>Concerning the Stork.</cite>”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/img021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Epiphanius, 1588.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>The Stork is described as a bird of extreme purity; and as
nourishing, with wonderful affection, father and mother in their
old age. The “interpretation” or application of the fact is;—“So
also it behoves us to observe these two divine commands,
that is to turn aside from evil and to do good, as the kingly
prophet wrote; and likewise in the decalogue the Lord commands,
thus saying;—Honour thy father and thy mother.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a similar way the properties and habits of various animals,—of
the lion, the elephant, the stag, the eagle, the pelican, the
partridge, the peacock, &amp;c., are adduced to enforce or symbolize
virtues of the heart and life, and to set forth the doctrines of the
writer’s creed.</p>

<p class='c000'>To illustrate the Emblem side of Christian Art a great
variety of information exists in <cite>Sketches of the History of
Christian Art</cite>, by Lord Lindsay (3 vols. 8vo: Murray, London,
1847); and Northcote and Brownlow’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Roma Sotterranea</cite></span>, compiled
from De Rossi (8vo: Longmans, London, 1869) promises
to supply many a symbol and type of a remote age fully to set
forth the same subject.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_0'>
IN the use of the word Emblem there is seldom
a strict adherence observed to an exact definition,—so,
when Emblem Literature is spoken of,
considerable latitude is taken and allowed as to
the kind of works which the terms shall embrace.
In one sense every book which has a picture set in it, or on it,
is an emblem-book,—the diagrams in a mathematical treatise or
in an exposition of science, inasmuch as they may be, and often
are, detached from the text, are emblems; and when to Tennyson’s
exquisite poem of “<span class='sc'>Elaine</span>,” Gustave Doré conjoins those
wonderful drawings which are themselves poetic, he gives us a
book of emblems;—Tennyson is the one artist that out of the
gold of his own soul fashioned a vase incorruptible,—and Doré
is that second artist who placed about it ornaments of beauty,
fashioned also out of the riches of his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet by universal consent, these and countless other works,
scientific, historical, poetic, and religious, which artistic skill has
embellished, are never regarded as emblematical in their character.
The “picture and short posie, expressing some particular
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>conceit,” seem almost essential for bringing any work within the
province of the Emblem Literature;—but the practical application
of the test is conceived in a very liberal spirit, so that while
the small fish sail through, the shark and the sea-dog rend the
meshes to tatters.</p>

<p class='c000'>A proverb or witty saying, as, in Don Sebastian Orozco’s
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">“<span class='sc'>Emblemas Morales</span>”</span> (Madrid 1610), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Divesqve miserqve,”</span>
<em>both rich and wretched</em>, may be pictured by king Midas at the
table where everything is turned to gold, and may be set forth
in an eight-lined stanza, to declare how the master of millions
was famishing though surrounded by abundance;—and these
things constitute the Emblem. Some scene from Bible History
shall be taken, as, in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class="blackletter">Les figures du vieil Testament, &amp; du
nouuel</span>”</span> (at Paris, about 1503), <em>Moses at the burning bush</em>;
where are printed, as if an Emblem text, the passage from
Exodus iii. 2–4, and by its side the portraits of David and
Esaias; across the page is a triplet woodcut, representing
Moses at the bush, and Mary in the stable at Bethlehem with
Christ in the manger-cradle; various scrolls with sentences from
the Scriptures adorn the page:—such representations claim a
place in the Emblem Literature. Boissard’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Theatrum Vitæ
Humanæ</cite></span> (Metz, 1596) shall mingle, in curious continuity, the
Creation and Fall of Man, Ninus king of the Assyrians, Pandora
and Prometheus, the Gods of Egypt, the Death of Seneca,
Naboth and Jezabel, the Advent of Christ and the Last Judgment;—yet
they are all Emblems,—because each has a “picture
and a short posie” setting forth its “conceit.” To be sure there
are some pages of Latin prose serving to explain or confuse, as
the case may be, each particular imagination; but the text
constitutes the emblem, and however long and tedious the
comment, it is from the text the composition derives its name.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<span class="blackletter">Stam und Wapenbuch hochs und niders Standts</span>,”</span>—<em>A
stem and armorial Bearings-book of high and of low Station</em>,—printed
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>at Frankfort-on-Mayne, 1579, presents above 270
woodcuts of the badges, shields and helmets, with appropriate
symbols and rhymes, belonging as well to the humblest who
can claim to be <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“vom gutem Geschlecht,”</span> <em>of good race</em>, as to
the Electoral Princes and to the Cæsarean Majesty of the Holy
Roman Empire. Most of the figures are illustrated by Latin
and German verses, and again “picture and short posie” vindicate
the title,—book of Emblems.</p>

<p class='c000'>And of the same character is a most artistic work by
Theodore de Bry, lately added to the treasure-house at Keir;
it is also a <cite>Stam und Wapenbuch</cite>, issued at Frankfort in 1593,
with ninety-four plates all within most beautiful and elaborate
borders. Its Latin title, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Emblema Nobilitate et Vulgo scitu
digna, &amp;c.</cite></span>, declares that these Emblems are “worthy to be
known both by nobles and commons.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so when an Emperor is married, or the funeral rites of
a Sovereign Prince celebrated, or a new saint canonized, or
perchance some proud cardinal or noble to be glorified, whatever
Art can accomplish by symbol and song is devoted to the
emblem-book pageantry,—and the graving tool and the printing
press accomplish as enduring and wide-spread a splendour as
even Titian’s Triumphs of Faith and Fame.</p>

<p class='c000'>Devotion that seeks wisdom from the skies, and Satire that
laughs at follies upon the earth, both have claimed and used
emblems as the exponents of their aims and purposes.</p>

Plate II.) They are indeed divine Images portrayed for us, and
the great word is added from the beloved disciple,—“Behold,
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>we should be called the sons of God.” And the simple <em>Refrain</em>

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Centifolium Stultorum</span>,”</span> edition 1707, or <cite>Hundred-leaved
Book of Fools</cite> of the eighteenth, proves how the Satirical may
symbolize and fraternize with the Emblematical. The title of
the book alone is sufficient to show what a vehicle for lashing
men’s faults the device with its stanzas and comment may be
made; it is, “A hundred-leaved book of Fools, in Quarto; or an
hundred exquisite Fools newly warmed up, in Folio,—in an
Alapatrit-Pasty for the show-dish; with a hundred fine copper
engravings, for honest pleasure and useful pastime, intended as
well for frolicsome as for melancholy minds; enriched moreover
with a delicate sauce of many Natural Histories, gay Fables,
short Discourses, and edifying Moral Lessons.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the one hundred <em>distinguished</em> characters, we might
select, were it only in self-condemnation, the Glass and Porcelain
dupe, the Antiquity and Coin-hunting dupe, and especially
the Book-collecting dupe. These are among the best of the
devices, and the stanzas, and the expositions. Dupes of every
kind, however, may find their reproof in the six simple German
lines,—p. 171,</p>

<p class='c000'>But Politics also have the bright, if not the dark, side of their
nature presented to the world in Emblems. Giulio Capaccio,
Venetia, 1620, derives <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Il Principe</span>,”</span> <cite>The Prince</cite>, from the
Emblems of Alciatus, “with two hundred and more Political
and Moral Admonitions,” “useful,” he declares, “to every
gentleman, by reason of its excellent knowledge of the customs,
economy, and government of States.” Jacobus à Bruck, of
Angermunt, in his “<span class='sc'>Emblemata Politica</span>,” <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1618, briefly
demonstrates those things which concern government; but Don
Diego Saavedra Faxardo, who died in 1648, in a work of considerable
repute,—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Idea</span> de vn Principe Politico-Christiano,
representada <span class='sc'>en cien Empresas</span>,”</span>—<cite>Idea of a Politic-Christian
Prince, represented in one hundred Emblems</cite> (edition, Valencia,
1655), so accompanies his Model Ruler from the cradle to
maturity as almost to make us think, that could we find the bee-bread
on which Kings should be nourished, it would be no more
difficult a task for a nation to fashion a perfect Emperor than it
is for a hive to educate their divine-right ruling Queen.</p>

<div class='illo'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>But, so great is the variety of subjects to which the illustrations
from Emblems are applied, that we shall content ourselves
with mentioning one more, taking out the arguments, as
they are named, from celebrated classic poets, and converting
them into occasions for pictures and short posies. Thus, like
the dust of Alexander, the remains of the mighty dead, of
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>Homer and Virgil, of Ovid and Horace, have served the base
uses of Emblem-effervescence, and in nearly all the languages of
Europe have been forced to misrepresent the noble utterances of
Greece and Rome. Many of the pictures, however, are very
beautiful, finely conceived, and skilfully executed;—we blame
not the artists, but the false taste which must make little bits
of verses where the originals existed as mighty poems.</p>

<p class='c000'>Generally it is considered that the Ovids of the fifteenth
century were without pictorial illustrations, and could not, therefore,
be classed among books of Emblems; but the Blandford
Catalogue, p. 21, records an edition, “Venetia, 1497,” “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>cum
figuris depictis</em></span>,”—with figures portrayed. Without discussing
the point, we will refer to an undoubted emblematized edition
of the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> of Ovid, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Figurato &amp; abbreviato in
forma d’Epigrammi da M. Gabriello Symeoni,”</span>—<em>figured and
abbreviated in form of Epigrams by M. Gabriel Symeoni</em>. The
volume is a small 4to of 245 pages, of which 187 have each
a title and device and Italian stanza, the whole surrounded by a
richly figured border. The volume, dedicated to the celebrated
“Diana di Poitiers, Dvchessa di Valentinois,” was published <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“A
Lione per Giouanni di Tornes nella via Resina, 1559.”</span> An
Example, p. 13, (see Plate III.,) will show the character of the
work, of which another edition was issued in 1584. The Italian
stanzas are all of eight lines each, and the passages of the
original Latin on which they are founded are collected at the
end of the volume. Thus, for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“La Creatione &amp; confusione del
Mondo,”</span> the Latin lines are,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>Ante mare &amp; terras &amp; quod tegit omnia, cœlum.</em></span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Of the devices several are very closely imitated in the woodcuts
of Reusner’s Emblems, published at Frankfort, in 1581.
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>The engravings in Symeoni’s Ovid are the work of Solomon
Bernard, “the little Bernard,” a celebrated artist born at Lyons
in 1512; who also produced a set of vignettes for a French
translation of Virgil, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>L’Eneide de Virgile, Prince des Poetes
latins</cite></span>, printed at Lyons in 1560.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Qvinti Horatii Flacci Emblemata</span>,”</span> as Otho Vænius
names one of his choicest works, first published in 1607, is a
similar adaptation of a classic author to the prevailing taste of
the age for emblematical representation. The volume is a very
fine 4to of 214 pages, of which 103 are plates; and a corresponding
103 contain extracts from Horace and other Latin
authors, followed, in the edition of 1612, by stanzas in Spanish,
Italian, French and Flemish. An example of the execution of
the work will be found as a Photolith, <a href='#plate17'>Plate XVII.</a>, near the end
of our volume; it is the “<span class='sc'>Volat irrevocabile tempus</span>,”—<em>Irrevocable
time is flying</em>,—so full of emblematical meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the office of the no less celebrated Crispin de Passe,
at Utrecht, in 1613, issued, in Latin and French verse,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Specvlvm Heroicvm</span> Principis omnium temporum Poëtarum
<span class='sc'>Homeri</span>,”</span>—<cite>The Heroic Mirror of Homer, the Prince of the
Poets of all times</cite>. The various arguments of the twenty-four
books of the <cite>Iliad</cite> have been taken and made the groundwork
of twenty-four Emblems, with their devices most admirably
executed. The Latin and French verses beneath each device
unmistakeably impress a true emblem-character on the work.
The author, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“le Sieur J. Hillaire,”</span> appends to the Emblems,
pp. 69–75, “Epitaphs on the Heroes who perished in the Trojan
War,” and also <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“La course d’Vlisses, son tragitte retour, &amp;
deffaicte des amans qui poursuivoient la chaste &amp; vertueuse
Penelope.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'>What might not in this way be included within the wide-encompassing
grasp of the determined Emblematist it is almost
impossible to say; and therefore it ought to be no matter of
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>surprise to find there is practically a greater extent given to the
Literature of Emblems than of absolute right belongs to it. We
shall not go much astray if we take Custom for our guide, and
keep to its decisions as recorded in the chief catalogues of
Emblem works.</p>

LEAVING for the most part out of view the
discussions which have taken place as to the
exact time and the veritable originators of the
arts of printing by fixed or moveable types,
and of the embellishing of books by engravings on blocks of
wood or plates of copper, we are yet—for the full development
of the condition and extent of the Emblem Literature in the age
of Shakespeare—required to notice the growth of that species of
ornamental device in books which depends upon Emblems for
its force and meaning. We say advisedly “ornamental device
in books,” for infinite almost are the applications of Symbol and
Emblem to Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting, as is testified
by the Remains of Antiquity in all parts of the world, by the
Pagan tombs and Christian catacombs of ancient Rome, by
nearly every temple and church and stately building in the
empires of the earth, and especially in those wonderful creations
of human skill in which form and colour bring forth to sight
nearly every thought and fancy of our souls.</p>

<p class='c021'>Long before either block-printing or type-printing was practised,
it is well known how extensively the limner’s art was
employed “to illuminate,” as it is called, the Manuscripts that
were to be found in the rich abbeys or convents, and in the
mansions of the great and noble. For instance, the devices
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>in the <cite>Dance of Macaber</cite>, undoubtedly
an Emblem Manuscript of the
fourteenth century, were of painter’s
workmanship, and afterwards employed
by the wood-engravers to
embellish type-printed volumes of a
devotional character. To this Brunet,
in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manuel du Libraire</cite></span>, vol. v.
c. 1557–1560, bears witness, when
speaking of the printer Philip Pigouchet,
and of the bookseller Simon
Vostre, who <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“furent les premiers à
Paris qui surent allier avec succès la
gravure à la typographie;”</span> and adds
in a note, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“La plus ancienne édition

the first work he sent forth after his establishment in that
city. (See <cite>Biog. Univ.</cite>, vol. xxx. p. 381, and vol. xxxvii. p. 25.)
But the most thoroughly emblematical work from Ratdolt’s
press was an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Astrolabium planũ in tabulis</span>,”</span> “wrought out
anew by John Angeli, master of liberal arts, <span class='fss'>MCCCCLXXXVIII</span>.”
There are 414 woodcuts, and all of them emblematical.
The library at Keir contains a perfect copy, 4to, in most
admirable condition. Brunet, i. c. 290, names a Venice edition
in 1494, and refers to other astronomical works by the same
author.</p>

<p class='c000'>In its manuscript form, too, the celebrated <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Speculum
Humanæ Salvationis</span>,”</span> <cite>Mirror of Human Salvation</cite>, exhibits
throughout the emblem characteristics. Of this work, both
as it exists in manuscript and in the earliest printed form
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>by Koster of Haarlem, about 1430, specimens are given in
“A History of the Art of Printing from its invention to its
wide spread developement in the middle of the sixteenth
century;” “by <span class='sc'>H. Noel Humphreys</span>,” “with one hundred
illustrations produced in Photo-lithography;” folio: Quaritch,
London, 1867. Pl. 8 of Humphreys’ learned and magnificent
volume exhibits “a page from a manuscript copy of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Speculum Humanæ Salvationis</cite></span>, executed previous to the
printed edition attributed to Koster;” and pl. 10, “A page
from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Speculum Humanæ Salvationis</cite></span> attributed to Koster
of Haarlem, in which the text is printed from moveable
types.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The inspection of these plates, and the assurance by Humphreys,
p. 60, that “the illustrations, though inferior to Koster’s
woodcuts, are of similar arrangement,” may satisfy us that the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Speculum Humanæ Salvationis</cite></span>, and all its kindred works, in
German, Dutch, and French, amounting to many editions
previous to the year 1500,<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a> are truly books that belong to the
Emblem literature. Thus pl. 8, “though without the decorative
Gothic framework which separates, and, at the same time,
binds together the double illustrations of the xylographic artist,”
exhibits to us the exact character of “the double pictures of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Speculum</cite></span>.” “These double pictures,” p. 60 of Humphreys,
“illustrate first a passage in the New Testament, and secondly
the corresponding subject of the Old, of which it is the antitype.
In the present page we have Christ bearing His cross (Christus
bajulat crucem) typified by Isaac carrying the wood for his own
sacrifice (Isaac portat ligna sua).” “The engravings,” p. 58,
“<em>i.e.</em>, of Koster’s first great effort, occur at the top of each leaf,
and the rest of the page is filled with two columns of text,
which, in the supposed first edition, is composed of Latin verse</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>(or, rather, Latin prose with rhymed terminations to the lines, as
the lines do not scan); and in later editions, in Dutch prose.”
“This specimen,” pl. 8, p. 60, “will enable the student to
understand precisely the kind of manuscript book which Koster
reproduced in a cheaper form by xylography, to which he
eventually allied the still more important invention of moveable
types.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From a very fine MS. copy of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Speculum Humanæ Salvationis</cite></span>,
belonging to Mr. Henry Yates Thompson, our fac-simile
Plates IV. and V., though on a smaller scale, present the Title
and the first Pair of devices with their text. The work is in
twenty-nine chapters, and to each there are four devices in four
columns, with appropriate explanations in Latin verse, and at
the foot of the columns are the references to the Old or the
New Testament.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manuscript entitled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">De Volueribus, sive de tribus
Columbis</span>,”</span>—<cite>Concerning Birds, or the Three Doves</cite>, in the library
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“du Grand Seminaire,”</span> at Bruges, is also an emblem-book.
It is excellently illuminated, and the workmanship is probably
of the thirteenth century. (See the Whitney Reprint,
p. xxxii.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The illuminated <cite>Missal</cite>,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a> executed in 1425 for John, Duke of
Bedford and regent of France, according to the account published
of it by Richard Gough, 4to, London, 1794, and by
others, abounds in emblem devices. It contains “fifty-nine
large miniatures, which nearly occupy the page, and above a
thousand small ones in circles of about an inch and half
diameter, displayed in brilliant borders of golden foliage, with
variegated flowers, &amp;c. At the bottom of every page are two
lines in blue and gold letters, which explain the subject of each
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>miniature.” “The Missal,” says Dibdin, “frequently displays
the arms of these noble personages,” (John, Duke of Bedford,
and of his wife Jane, daughter of the Duke of Burgundy,)
“and also affords a pleasing testimony of the affectionate
gallantry of the pair: the motto of the former being ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span class='fss'>A
VOUS ENTIER</span></span>;’ that of the latter, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span class='fss'>J’EN SUIS CONTENTE</span>.</span>’”
Among its ornaments are emblems or symbols of the twelve
months, and a large variety of paintings derived from the
Sacred Scriptures, many of which possess an emblematical
meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not aiming at any exhaustive method in the information we
gather and impart respecting Emblem works and editions
previous to the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1500, we pass by the very numerous
other instances in support of our theme which a search into
manuscripts would supply. The “Block-Books,”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a> which, in the
main, are especially emblematical, we next consider. We select
two instances as representative of the whole set;—namely, the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Biblia Pauperum</span>,”</span> <cite>Bibles of the Poor</cite>, and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Ars Memorandi</span>,”</span>
<cite>The Art of Remembering</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his “<span class='sc'>Bibliographical Decameron</span>,” vol. i. p. 160,
Dibdin tells us, “The earliest printed book, containing <em>text</em> and
<em>engravings</em> illustrative of scriptural subjects, is called the <cite>Histories
of Joseph, Daniel, Judith, and Esther</cite>. This was executed
in the German language, and was printed by Pfister at Bamberg
in 1462. It is among the rarest of typographical curiosities in
existence.” Dibdin’s dictum is considerably modified, if not set
aside, by Noel Humphreys; who, though affirming, p. 41, that
“a late German edition of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Biblia Pauperum</cite></span> has the date
1475, but that before that period editions had been printed at
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>the regular press with moveable types, as, for instance, that of
Pfister, printed at Bamberg in 1462,”—yet had previously declared,
p. 39, “many suppose that Laurens Koster, of Haarlem,
who afterwards invented moveable types, was one of the earliest
engravers of Block-books, and that in fact the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Biblia Pauperum</cite></span>
was actually his work.” “The period of its execution
may probably be estimated as lying between 1410 and 1420:
probably earlier, but certainly not later.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The earliest editions of these <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Biblia Pauperum</cite></span> contain
forty leaves, the later editions fifty, printed only on one side.
Opposite to p. 40, Noel Humphreys gives, pl. 2, “A Page from
the Biblia Pauperum generally supposed to be one of the
earliest block-books.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Availing ourselves of the Author’s remarks, p. 40, we yet
prefer, on account of some inaccuracies in his decyphering the
Latin contractions, giving our own description of this plate.
The page is in <em>three</em> divisions, all in the Gothic decorative style,
with separating archways between the subjects. In the <em>upper</em>
division, in the centre, are seated, each in his niche, “Isaya” and
“Dauid.” (See Plate VI.) In the upper corners, on the right
hand of the first, and on the left hand of the second, are Latin
inscriptions,—the former relating to Eve’s seed bruising the
serpent’s head, Genesis iii. c., and the latter to Gideon’s fleece
saturated with dew, Judges vi. c. The <em>middle</em> compartment is a
triptych, consisting of Eve’s Temptation, the Annunciation by
the Angel to the Blessed Virgin; and Gideon in his armour, on
his knees, with his shield on the ground, watching the fleece.
Over Eve’s Temptation there is a scroll issuing from Isaiah’s
niche, and having this inscription: <span class="blackletter"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ecce virgo concipiet et pariet
filium,”</span></span>—<em>Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son</em>, Is. vii. 14;
Eve stands near the tree of life, emblematized by God the
Father among the branches,—and erect before her is the serpent,
almost on the tip of its tail, with its body slightly curved. In
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>the Annunciation appears a ray of light breathed upon the
Virgin from God the Father seated in the clouds, and in the ray
are the dove, the emblem of the Holy Spirit, descending, and an
infant Christ bearing his cross; the Angel stands before Mary
addressing to her the salutation, “<span class="blackletter">Ave gratiâ plena, dominus
tecum</span>,”—<em>Hail full of grace, the Lord is with thee</em>, Luke i. 28; and
Mary, seated with a book on her knees, and her hands devoutly
crossed on her breast, replies, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class="blackletter">Ecce, ancilla domini, fiat mihi</span>,</span>”—Behold,
<em>the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me</em>, Luke i. 38. Of
Gideon and the fleece little needs be said, except that over him
from the niche of David issues a scroll with the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Descendet
dominus sicut pluvia in vellus</span>,”</span> in the Latin Vulgate, Ps. lxxi. 6,
<em>i.e. The Lord shall descend as rain upon the fleece</em>; but in the
English version, Ps. lxxii. 6, <em>He shall come down like rain upon
the mown grass</em>. The Angel also addressing Gideon bears a
scroll, not quite legible, but evidently meaning, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Dominus tecum
virorum fortissime</span>,”</span> Judges vi. 12,—English version, <em>The Lord is
with thee, thou mighty man of valour</em>. The <em>lower</em> compartment,
like the upper, has in the centre two arched niches, which contain,
the one Ezekiel, the other Jeremiah; beneath Eve’s temptation
and Gideon’s omen are the alliterative and rhyming
couplets</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Passing by similar Block-books, as <cite>The Book of Canticles</cite>,
and <cite>The Apocalypse of St. John</cite>, we will conclude the subject
with a notice of Humphreys’ pl. 5, following p. 42 of his
text; it is “A Subject from the Block-book entitled ‘Ars
memorandi,’ executed probably at the beginning of the fifteenth
century.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The entire work,” we are informed, p. 42, “consists of the
symbols of the four evangelists, each occupying a page, and
being most grotesquely treated, the bull of St. Luke and the
lion of St. Mark standing upright on their hind legs. These
symbols are surrounded with various objects, calculated to recall
the leading events in their respective Gospels.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the whole passage in explanation of the Plate is so much
to our purpose, that we ask pardon of the author for inserting it
entire. He says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The page I have selected for reproduction is the fourth ‘image or
symbol’ of St. Matthew—the Angel. The objects grouped around are many
of them very curious, and, without the assistance of the accompanying
explanations, would certainly not serve to aid the memory of the modern
Biblical students. The symbolic Angel holds in the left hand objects numbered
18, which by the explanation we learn to be the sun and moon,
accompanied by an unusual arrangement of stars and planets; intended to
recall the passage, ‘there were signs in the sun and moon’—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>erant signa
in sole et luna</em></span>. I give the text of monkish explanation in MS. No. 19, the
clasped hands, represents marriage, in reference to the generations of the
Ancestors of Christ as enumerated by St. Matthew. No. 20, the cockle
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>shell and the bunch of grapes are emblems of travelling and pilgrimage, and
appear to represent the flight into Egypt; 21, the head of an ass, is intended
to recall the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem riding on an ass; 22, a table,
with bread-knife and drinking cup, recalls the Last Supper (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Cæna magna</em></span>);
and the accompanying symbol, without a number, represents the census
rendered to Cæsar.”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>With great kindness Mr. Corser, of Stand, offered me, in the
spring of 1868, the use of a very choice Block-book, soon after
sold for £415, entitled <cite>Historia S. Joan. Euangelist. per Figuras</cite>,
and which is, I believe, the very copy from which Sotheby’s
specimens of the work are taken. Whether it be the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>editio
princeps</em>,”</span> as a former owner claimed it to be, is doubted
on merely conjectural grounds; but a most precious copy it
is, internally vindicating its claim to priority. The volume
measures 2.82 decimetres by 2.14; or 11 inches by 8.42. There
are forty-eight leaves, in perfect preservation, printed on one
side. The figures, all coloured, relate either to the traditions
and legends of the Evangelist, or to the visions of the
Apocalypse, the former being simply pictorial, the latter emblematical.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two Plates uncoloured (Plate <a href='#plate07'>VII</a>. and Plate <a href='#plate08'>VIII</a>.)
very clearly show the difference between the mere drawing
and the device. The pictures of the Evangelist preaching, of
Drusiana being baptized, and of the search after John, have
no meaning beyond the historical or legendary event;—but
the two wings of an eagle given to the woman, of the angel
flying with a book above the tree of life, of the dragon persecuting
the woman, and of the mother-church passing
into the desert: these have a meaning beyond that of the
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>figures delineated;—they are emblematical of hidden truths;—so
are all the other plates of this Block-book which represent
the visions of the Apocalypse. The date is probably
1420 to 1425.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bodleian Library at Oxford is very rich in this particular
Block-book, possessing no fewer than <em>three</em> copies of the <cite>History
of S. John the Evangelist</cite>. Among its treasures, however, is a
MS. on the same subject, worth them all by reason of its beauty
and exquisite finish, which the Block-books certainly do not
claim. This MS., on fine vellum and finely drawn and illuminated,
is said to have been written in the twelfth century, and
to have belonged to Henry II.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the printing with moveable types is firmly established,
and Emblem-books are among its earliest productions. At
Bamberg, a city on the Regnitz, near its influx into the Main,
the first purely German book was printed in 1461, by the same
Pfister who published an edition of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Biblia Pauperum</cite></span>, and
who probably learned his art at Mayence with Guttenberg
himself. The work in question was a Collection of eighty-five
Fables in German, with 101 vignettes cut on wood, each
accompanied by a German text of rhyming verses. The first
device, says Brunet, vol. i. p. 1096, represents three apes and
a tree, and the verses begin with—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Once on a time came an ape (<em>gerãt</em>) upright.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The colophon, or subscription, at the end informs us,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“At Bamberg this little book ended is</div>
      <div class='line'>After the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,</div>
      <div class='line'>When one counts a thousand four hundred year,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to it, as truth, one and sixty more,</div>
      <div class='line'>On the day of holy Valentine;</div>
      <div class='line'>God shield us from the wrath divine. Amen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The fables were collected by Ulric Boner, a Dominican friar
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>of Bonn, in the thirteenth or at the beginning of the fourteenth
century. Their chief value is that they present the most precious
remains of the Minnesingers, or German Troubadours, and
possess much grace, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“une moralité piquante.”</span> See <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Biographie
Universelle</cite></span>, vol. v. pp. 97, 98: Paris, 1812; and vol. xxxiii.
p. 584: Paris, 1823.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Æsop’s <cite>Fables</cite> in Greek, the Milan edition, about A.D.
1480, was the earliest. There had been Latin versions, previously
at Rome in 1473, at Bologna and Antwerp in 1486,
and elsewhere. The German translation appeared in 1473, the
Italian in 1479, the French and the English in 1484, and the
Spanish in 1489. Besides these there were at least thirty other
editions previous to the year 1500.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been doubted if Fables should be classed among
the Emblem Literature,—but whether <em>nude</em>, as other emblems
have been named when unclothed in the ornaments of wood
or copper engravings, or <em>adorned</em> with richly embellished
devices, they are, as Whitney would name them, <em>naturally</em>
emblematical. Apart from whatever artistic skill can effect
for them, they have in themselves meanings to be evolved
different from those which the words convey. The Lion,
the Fox, and the Ass are not simply names for the
veritable animals, but emblems of different characters and
qualities among the human race; they symbolize moral
sentiments and actions, and when we add the figures of the
creatures, though we may make pleasing and significant
pictures, we do little for the real development of the
emblems.</p>

<p class='c000'>Books of Fables, however, are so numerous that they and
their editors may be counted by hundreds; and as Dibdin
intimates, the Bibliomaniac who had gathered up all the editions
of Æsop in nearly all the languages of the civilized world,
would have formed a very considerable library. Only on a few
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>occasions therefore shall we make mention of books of Fables in
our present inquiries.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall not however pass unnoticed, since it belongs
especially to this period, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Dyalogus Creaturarum</span>,”</span> or,
<cite>Dialogues of the Creatures</cite>, a collection of Latin Fables,
attributed in the fourteenth century to Nicolas Pergaminus,
first printed at Gouda in Holland by Gerard Leeu in 1480,
and at Stockholm by John Snell in 1483. (See Brunet, vol. ii.
p. 674.) A French version, by Colard Mansion, was issued at
Lyons in 1482, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Dialogue des Creatures moralizie</cite></span>; and an
English version, about 1520, by J. Rastall, “Powly’s Churche,”
London, namely, “The Dialogue of Creatures moralyzed, of
late translated out of latyn in to our English tonge.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Dyalogus Creat., ed. 1480.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There were various editions and modifications of the work,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
but perhaps the contrast between them cannot be better pointed
out than by selecting the Fable of the Wolf and the Ass from
the Gouda edition of 1480, and also from the Antwerp edition
of 1584. The original edition, with the woodcut on the next
page in mere outline, tells in simple Latin prose how a wolf and
an ass were sawing a log of wood together. From good nature
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>the ass worked up above, the wolf through maliciousness
down below, desiring to find an opportunity for devouring the
ass; therefore he complained that the ass was sending the
sawdust into his eyes. The ass replied, “It is not I who am
doing this,—I only guide the saw. If you wish to saw up
above I am content,—I will work faithfully down below.” And
so they talked on, until the wolf threatening revenge drew back,
and the fissure in the beam being suddenly widened, the wedge
fell upon the wolf’s head, and the wolf himself was killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Antwerp edition of 1584<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a> changes the simple Latin prose
into the elegant Latin elegiacs of John Moerman, and the outline

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Wolf and careless Ass a treaty made,</div>

<p class='c000'>As in the Blandford Catalogue, it has been usual to count
among Emblem-books the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Ecatonphyla</span>,”</span> printed at Venice
in 1491. The French translation of 1536 describes the title as,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“signifiãt centiesme amour, sciemment appropriees a la dame
ayãt en elle autant damour que cent aultres dames en pouroient
comprendre,”</span> <em>signifying a hundredth love, knowingly appropriated
to the lady having in her as much love as a hundred other ladies
could possibly comprehend</em>. (Brunet’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manuel</cite></span>, i. c. 131, 132.) The
author of this work, of which there are several editions, was the
celebrated Italian architect, Leoni-Baptista Alberti, born of a
noble family of Florence in 1398, and living as some suppose up
to 1480. He was a universal scholar, a doctor of laws, a priest,
a painter, and a good mechanic.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are inclined to ask whether <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Gli Trionfi del Petrarcha</cite></span>,
printed at Bologna in 1475,—especially, when as in the Venice
editions of 1500 and 1523 they were adorned by the vignettes
and wood engravings of Zoan Andrea Veneziano,—whether
these “Triumphs of Love, Chastity, and Death” may not, from
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>their highly allegorical character, be included among the
Emblem-books of this age?<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a> The same question we might ask
respecting “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><span class="blackletter">Das Heldenbuch</span></span>,”—<cite>The Book of Heroes</cite>,—printed
at Augsburg, in 1477, by Gunther Zainer, who had first been a
printer at Cracow about 1465; and also concerning the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Libri
Cronicarum cũ figuris et imaginibus ab inicio mũdi</span>,”</span> a large folio
known as the <cite>Chronicles of Nuremberg</cite>, which with its 2000 fine
wood engravings, attributed to Michael Wohlgemuth, was
published in that city in 1493.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The original “<span class="blackletter">Todtentanz</span>,” or <cite>Dance of Death</cite>, painted as a
memorial of the plague which raged during the Council of Bâle,
held between 1431 and 1446 (Bryan, p. 335), certainly was not
the work of either of the Holbeins. There are several representations
of a Death-dance in the fifteenth century, between
1485 and 1496 (Brunet, v. 873, 874); and there can be little
doubt of their emblematical character. The renowned <cite>Dance
of Death</cite> by Hans Holbein the younger we will reserve for its
proper place in the next section.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must not however leave unmentioned <cite>The Dance of Macaber</cite>,
especially as it is presented to us in an English form by John
Lydgate, a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Bury St. Edmunds,
who was born about 1375, and attained his greatest eminence
about 1430. His own power for supplying the materials for an
Emblem-device we observe in the lines on “<cite>God’s Providence</cite>.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“God hath a thousand handés to chastise;</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>For an account of Lydgate’s <cite>Dance of Macaber</cite>, and indeed

<p><em>Title of Brandts Stultifera Navis edition, 1497.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The earliest known edition of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Danse Macabre</cite></span>, originally
composed in German, is dated at Paris, 1484, but before the
completion of the century there were seven or eight other
reprints, some with alterations and others with additions. It
was a most popular work, issued at least eight or ten times
during the sixteenth century, and still exciting interest.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a> At
p. 39 may be seen copies of some of the devices as used by
Verard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief Emblem deviser and writer towards the end of the
century was Sebastian Brandt, born at Strasburg in 1458, and
after a life of great usefulness and honour dying at Bâle in 1520.
The publication in German Iambic verse of his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<span class="blackletter">Narren
Schyff</span>,”</span> Bâle, Nuremberg, Rüttlingen, and Augsburg, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1494,
forms quite an epoch in Emblem-book literature. Previous
to <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1500, <em>Locher</em>, crowned poet laureate by the Emperor
Maximilian I., translated the German into Latin verse, with the
title <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Stultifera Nauis</span>”</span> (see Plate IX.); <em>Riviere</em> of Poitiers,
the Latin into French verse, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class="blackletter">La Nef des Folz du Monde</span>;”</span>
and <em>Droyn</em> of Amiens, into French prose, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class="blackletter">La grãt Nef des Folz
du Monde</span>.”</span> Early in the next century, 1504, or even in 1500,
there was a Flemish version; and in 1509 two English versions,—<em>one</em>
translated out of French, “<span class='sc'>The Shyppe of Fooles</span>,” by
Henry Watson, and printed by “Wynkyn de Worde, <span class='fss'>MCCCCCIX</span>.”
(see Dibdin’s <cite>Tour</cite>, ii. p. 103); <em>the other</em>,—“<span class='sc'>Stultifera
Nauis</span>,” or “<span class="blackletter">The Shyp of Folys of the Worlde</span>;” “Inprentyd
in the Cyte of London, by Richard Pynson, <span class='fss'>M.D.IX.</span>” (Dibdin’s
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span><cite>Typ. Ant.</cite> ii. p. 431.) This latter was “<em>translated out of Latin,
French, and Duch into Englishe</em>, by Alexander Barclay, <em>Priest</em>;”
and reprinted in 1570, during Shakespeare’s childhood by the
“Printer to the Queenes Maiestie.” At the same time, 1570,
another work by Barclay was published, which, although
without devices, partakes of an allegorical or even of an
emblematical character; it is <cite>The Mirrour of good Maners</cite>;
“conteining the foure Cardinal Vertues.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dibdin, in his <cite>Bibliographical Antiquarian</cite>, iii. p. 101,
mentions “a pretty little volume—‘as fresh as a daisy,’ the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hortulus Rosarum de Valle Lachrymarum</cite></span>, ‘A little Garden of
Roses from the Valley of Tears’ (to which a Latin ode by
S. Brandt is prefixed), printed by J. de Olpe in 1499,”—but
he gives no intimation of its character; conjecturing from its
title and from the woodcuts with which it is adorned, it will
probably on further inquiry be found to bear an emblematical
meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dibdin also, in the same work, iii. p. 294, names “a German
version of the ‘<span class='sc'>Hortulus Animæ</span>’ of S. Brant,” in manuscript;
“undoubtedly,” he says, “among the loveliest books in
the Imperial Library.” The Latin edition was printed at
Strasburg in 1498, and is ornamented with figures on wood;
many of these are mere pictures, without any symbolical
meaning,—but it often is the case that the illuminated manuscripts,
especially if devotional, and the early printed books of
every kind that have pictorial illustrations in them, present
various examples of symbolical and emblematical devices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last works we shall name of the period antecedent to
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1501, are due to the industry and skill of John Sicile,
herald at arms to Alphonso King of Aragon, who died in 1458.
Sicile, it seems, prepared two manuscripts, <em>one</em> the Blazonry of
Arms,—the <em>other</em>, the Blazonry of Colours. Of the former there
was an edition printed at Paris in 1495, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Le</em> <span class='sc'>Blason</span> <em>de toutes
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>Armes et Ecutz</em></span>, &amp;c.—and of the latter at Lyons early in the
sixteenth century, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Le Blason des Couleurs en Armes, Liurees et
deuises</cite></span>. Within an hundred years, ending with 1595, above
sixteen editions of the two works were issued.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several other authors there are belonging to the period of
which we treat,—but enough have been named to show to what
an extent Emblem devices and Emblem-books had been
adopted, and with what an impetus the invention of moveable
types and greater skill in engraving had acted to multiply the
departments of the Emblem Literature. It was an impetus
which gathered new strength in its course, and which, previous
to Shakespeare’s youth and maturity, had made an entrance
into almost every European nation. Already in 1500, from
Sweden to Italy and from Poland to Spain, the touch was felt
which was to awaken nearly every city to the west of
Constantinople, to share in the supposed honours of adding to
the number of Emblem volumes.</p>

LABORIOUS in some degree is the enterprise which
the title of this Section will indicate before it shall
be ended. Perchance we shall have no myths to

<p class='c000'>Better, as I trust, to set this period of <em>sixty-three</em> years before
the mind, it may be well to take it in three divisions: 1st, the
twenty-one years before Alciatus appeared, to conquer for himself
a kingdom, and to reign king of Emblematists for about a century
and a half; 2nd, the twenty-one years from the appearance of the
first edition of Alciat’s <cite>Emblems</cite> in 1522 at Milan, until Hans
Holbein the younger had introduced the <cite>Images and Epigrams of
Death</cite>, and La Perriere and Corrozet, the one his <cite>Theatre of good

<h4 id='sec2.3.1' class='c023'></h4>
<p class='c003'>I.—<cite>A Fool-freighted Ship</cite> was the title of almost the last book
of the fifteenth century,—by a similar title is the Emblem-book
called which was launched at the beginning of the sixteenth
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>century; it is, “<span class="blackletter">Jodoci Badii ascē</span>sii Stultifere̦ nauicule̦ seu

citizen of Strasburg, in the year of Salvation <span class='fss'>M.CCCCC.II.</span>” There
was an earlier edition in 1500,—but almost exactly the same.
From that before us we give a specimen of the work, <cite>The Skiff
of Foolish Tasting</cite>. A discourse follows, with quotations from
Aulus Gellius, Saint Jerome, Virgil, Ezekiel, Epicurus, Seneca,
Horace, and Juvenal; and the discourse is crowned by twenty-four

<p class='c000'>The same work was published in another form, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“La nef des
folles, selon les cinq sens de nature, composé selon levangile de
monseigneur saint Mathieu, des cinq vierges qui ne prindrent
point duylle avec eulx pour mectre en leurs lampes:”</span> Paris 4to,
about 1501.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>Of Badius himself, born in 1462 and dying in 1535, it is to be
said that he was a man of very considerable learning, professor
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“belles lettres”</span> at Lyons from 1491 to 1511, when he was
tempted to settle in Paris. There he established the famous
Ascensian Printing Press,—and like Plantin of Antwerp, gave
his three daughters in marriage to three very celebrated
printers: Michel Vascosan, Robert Etienne, and Jean de Poigny.
He was the author of several works besides those that have
been mentioned. (<cite>Biog. Univ.</cite> vol. iii. p. 201.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Symphorien Champier, Doctor in Theology and Medicine, a
native of Lyons, who was physician to Anthony Duke of
Lorraine when he accompanied Louis XII. to the Italian war,
graduated at Pavia in 1515, and, after laying the foundations of
the Lyons College of Physicians, and enjoying the highest
honours of his native city, died about 1540. (Aikin’s <cite>Biog.</cite> ii.
579.) His medical and other works are of little repute, but
among them are two or three which may be regarded as imitations
of Emblem-books. We will just name,—Balsat’s work
with Champier’s additions, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Nef des Princes et des Batailles
de Noblesse, &amp;c.</cite></span> (Lyons, 4to goth. with woodcuts, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1502.);
also, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Nef des Dames vertueuses cōposee par Maistre Simphoriē
Champier, &amp;c.</cite></span> (Lyons, 4to goth. with woodcuts, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1503.)</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bible figures,” too, again have a claim to notice. A very fine
copy of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class="blackletter">Les figures du vieil Testament, &amp; du nouuel</span>,”</span> which
belonged to the Rev. T. Corser, Rector of Stand, near Manchester,
supplies the opportunity of noticing that it is decidedly
an Emblem work. It is a folio, of 100 leaves, containing forty-one
plates, of which one is introductory, and forty are on
Scriptural subjects, unarranged in order either of time or place.
The work was published in Paris in 1503 by Anthoine Verard,
and is certainly, as Brunet declares, ii. c. 1254, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“une imitation
de l’ouvrage connu sous le nom de <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Biblia Pauperum</cite></span>.”</span> There
are forty sets of figures in triptychs, the wood engravings
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>being very bold and good. Each is preceded or followed by a
French stanza of eight lines, declaring the subject; and has
appended two or three pages of Exposition, also in French.
The Device pages, each in three compartments, are in Latin,
and may thus be described. At the top to the left hand, a
quotation from the Vulgate appropriate to the pictorial representation
beneath it; in the centre two niches, of which David
always occupies one, and some writer of the Old Testament
the other, a scroll issuing from each niche. The middle compartment
is filled by a triptych, the centre subject from the New
Testament, the right and left from the Old. At the bottom are
Latin verses to the right and left, with two niches in the centre
occupied by biblical writers. The Latin verses are rhyming
couplets, as on fol. a. iiij, beneath Moses at the burning bush,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Lucet et ignescit, sed non rubus igne calescit</span>,”</span>—<em>It shines and
flames, but the bush is not heated by the fire</em>. In triptych, on
p. i. <em>rev.</em> are, Enoch’s Translation, Christ’s Ascension, and the
Translation of Elijah.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Aldine press at Venice, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1505, gave the world the
first printed edition of the “<span class='sc'>Hieroglyphica</span>” of Horapollo.
It was in folio, having in the same volume the Fables of Æsop,
of Gabrias, &amp;c. See Leemans’ <em>Horapollo</em>, pp. xxix-xxxv. A
Latin version by Bernard Trebatius was published at Augsburg
in 1515, at Bale in 1518, and at Paris in 1521; and another
Latin version by Phil. Phasianinus, at Bologna in 1517. Previous
to Shakespeare’s birth there were translations into French in
1543, into Italian in 1548, and into German in 1554,—and down
to 1616 sixteen other editions may readily be counted up.</p>

<p class='c000'>John Haller, who had introduced printing into Cracow in
1500, published in 1507 the first attempt to teach logic by
means of a game of cards; it was in Murner’s quarto entitled,
“<span class='sc'>Chartiludium</span> logice̦ seu Logica poetica vel memorativa
cum jocundo Pictasmatis Exercimento,”—<cite>A Card-game of Logic,
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>or Logic poetical or memorial, with the pleasant Exercise of pictured
Representation</cite>. It is a curious and ingenious work, and
reprints of it appeared at Strasburg in 1509 and 1518; at Paris,
by Balesdens, in 1629; and again in 1650, 4to, by Peter
Guischet. As an imitation of Brandt’s <em>Ship of Fools</em>, so far as
it relates to the follies and caprices of mankind, mention should
also be made of Murner’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<span class="blackletter">Narren Beschwo<sup>e</sup>rung</span>,”</span>—<em>Exorcism
of Fools</em>,—Strasburg, 4to, 1512 and 1518; which certainly at
Francfort, in 1620, gave origin to Flitner’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Nebvlo nebvlonvm</span>,”</span>—or,
<em>Rascal of Rascals</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Speculū Paciētierum</span> theologycis Consolationibus Fratris
Ioannis de Tambaco,”</span>—<em>The Mirror of Patience with the theological
Consolations of Brother John Tambaco</em>,—Nuremberg,
<span class='fss'>MCCCCCIX.</span>, 4to, is a work of much curiousness. On the reverse
of the title is an Emblematical device of Job, Job’s wife, and
the Devil, followed by exhortations to patience; and on the
reverse of the introduction to the second part, also an Emblematical
device,—the Queen of Consolation, with her four maidens
by her side, and two men kneeling before her. The chapters on
consolation are generally in the form of <em>sermonettes</em>, in which
the maidens, three or four, or even a dozen, expatiate on
different subjects proper for reproof, exhortation, and comfort.
The devices in this volume are understood to be from the pencil
of Albert Durer.</p>

<p class='c000'>This same year, 1509, witnessed two English translations, or
paraphrases, of Brandt’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<span class="blackletter">Narren Schif</span>,”</span>—the one <em>The Shyppe
of Fooles</em>, taken from the French by Henry Watson, and printed
by De Worde;—the other rendered out of Latin, German, and
French, <em>The Ship of Fooles</em>, by Alexander Barclay, and printed
by Pinson. Of Watson little, if anything, is known, but Barclay
is regarded as one of the improvers of the English tongue, and
to him it is chiefly owing that a true Emblem-book was made
popular in England.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>Of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Dyalogus Creaturarum</span>,”</span> written in the fourteenth
century by Nicolas Pergaminus, and printed by Gerard Leeu,
at Gouda, in 1480, an English version appeared about 1520,—“The
dialogue of Creatures moralyzed, of late translated out
of Latyn in to our English tonge.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The famous preacher and the founder of the first public
school in Strasburg was John Geyler, born in 1445. He was
highly esteemed by the Emperor Maximilian, and after a
ministry of about thirty years, died in 1510. Two Emblem-books
were left by him, both published in 1511 by James
Other;—the one <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Navicula sive Speculũ Fatuorum</span>,”</span>—<cite>The
little Ship or Mirror of Fools</cite>; the other, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class="blackletter">Navicula Penitentie</span>,”</span>—<cite>The
little Ship of Penitence</cite>. To the first there are 110 emblems
and 112 devices, each having a discourse delivered on one
of the Sabbaths or festivals of the Catholic Church—the text
always being, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Stultorum infinitus est</em></span>,—“Infinite is the number
of fools.” The second, not strictly an Emblem-book, is devoted
“to the praise of God and the salvation of souls in Strasburg,”
and consists really of a series of sermons for Lent and other seasons
of the year, but all having the same text, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Ecce ascendimus
Hierosolimam</em></span>,—“Behold we go up to Jerusalem.” There were
several reprints of both the works, and two German translations;
and the edition of 1520, folio, with wood engravings, is remarkable
for being the first book to which was granted the “Imperial
privilege.” It is said that the rhymes of Brandt’s <cite>Ship of Fools</cite>
which Geyler had translated into Latin in 1498, not unfrequently
served him for texts and quotations for his sermons. Alas! we
have no such lively preachers in these sleepy days of perfect
propriety of phrase and person. Our prophets, in putting away
“locusts and wild honey,” too often forget to cry, “Repent, for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, however, to the famous preacher, we name a notorious
prophet, the Abbot Joachim, who died between the years 1201
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>and 1202, but whose works, if they really were his, did not
appear in print, until the folio edition was issued about 1475,—<cite>Revelations
concerning the State of the chief Pontiffs</cite>. An Italian
version, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Prophetia</span> dello Abbate Joachimo circa li Pontefici
&amp; Re,”</span> appeared in 1515; and another Latin edition, with wood
engravings, by Marc-Antoine Raimondi, in 1516.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Many tales
are related of the Abbot and of his followers; suffice it to say,
that they maintained the Gospel of Christ would be abolished
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1260; and thenceforward Joachim’s “true and everlasting
Gospel” was to be prevalent in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to the Blandford <cite>Catalogue</cite>, p. 6, we should here
insert P. Dupont’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Satyriques Grotesques</cite></span> (Desseins Orig.), 8vo,
Paris, 1513; but it may be passed over with the simplest notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we judge from the wonderfully beautiful copy on finest
vellum in the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow, the next
Emblem-book surpasses all others we have named; it is the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<span class="blackletter">Tewrdannckh</span>”</span>—or, <em>Dear-thought</em>,—usually attributed to Melchior
Pfintzing, a German poet, born at Nuremberg in 1481, and
who at one time was secretary to the Emperor Maximilian.
The poem is allegorical and chivalric, and adorned with 118
plates, some of which are considered the workmanship of Albert
Durer.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>Tewrdanck</em> was intended to set forth the dangers and
love adventures of the emperor himself on occasion of his
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>marriage to the great heiress of that day, Mary of Burgundy.
There are some who believe that Maximilian was the author, or
at least that he sketched out the plan which Pfintzing executed.
As, however, the espousals took place in 1479, before the poet
was born, and Mary had early lost her life from a fall,—the
probability is that the emperor supplied some of the incidents
and suggestions, and that his secretary completed the work.
The splendid volume was dedicated to Charles V. in 1517, and
published the same year, a noble monument of typographic art.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of a later work known under the name of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<span class="blackletter">Turnierbuch</span>,”</span>—<cite>The
Tournament-book</cite>,—by George Rüxner, namely, <cite>Beginning,
Source, and Progress of Tournaments in the German nation</cite>
(Siemern, S. Rodler, 1530, folio, pp. 402), Brunet informs us
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manuel</cite></span>, vol. iv. c. 1471), “There are found for the most part in
this edition printed at the castle of Simmern” (about twenty-five
miles south of Coblentz) “in 1530, the characters already
employed in the two editions of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Tewrdannckh</cite></span> of 1517 and
1519; there may also be remarked numerous engravings on
wood of the same kind as those of the romance in verse we have
just cited.” The edition of 1532 “printed at the same castle,”
is not in the same characters as that of 1530.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Cebes</span>, the Theban, the disciple of Socrates, though mentioned
at pp. 12, 13, must again be introduced, for an edition of
his little work in Latin had appeared at Boulogne in 1497, and
at Venice in 1500; also at Francfort, “by the honest men
Lamperter and Murrer,” in 1507, with the letter of John Æsticampianus;
the Greek was printed by Aldus in 1503, and
several other editions followed up to the end of the century;—indeed
there were translations into Arabic, French, Italian,
German, and English.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>II.—<span class='sc'>Andrew Alciat</span>, the celebrated jurisconsult, remarkable,
as some testify, for serious defects, as for his surpassing
knowledge and power of mind, is characterized by Erasmus as
“the orator best skilled in law,” and “the lawyer most eloquent
of speech;”—of his composition there was published in 1522, at
Milan, an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Emblematum Libellus</cite></span>, or “Little Book of Emblems.”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
It established, if it did not introduce, a new style for Emblem
Literature, the classical in the place of the simply grotesque
and humorous, or of the heraldic and mythic. It is by no
means certain that the change should be named an unmixed
gain. Stately and artificial, the school of Alciat and his followers
indicates at every stanza its full acquaintance with
mythologies Greek and Roman, but it is deficient in the easy
expression which distinguishes the poet of nature above him
whom learning chiefly guides: it seldom betrays either enthusiasm
of genius or depth of imaginative power.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless the style chimed in with the taste of the age,
and the little book,—at least that edition of it which is the
earliest we have seen, Augsburg, <span class='fss'>A.D</span>. 1531,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a> contained in eighty-eight
pages, small 8vo, with ninety-seven Emblems and as
many woodcuts,—won its way from being a tiny volume of
11.5 square inches of letterpress on each of eighty-eight pages,
until with notes and comments it was comprised only in a large
4to of 1004 pages with thirty-seven square inches of letter-press
on each page. Thus the little one that had in it only
1012 square inches of text and picture became a mountain, a
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>monument in Alciat’s honour, numbering up 37,128 square
inches of text, picture, and comment. The <em>little</em> book of Augsburg,
1531, may be read and digested, but only an immortal
patience could labour through the entire of the <em>great</em> book of
Padua, 1621. In that interval of ninety years, however, edition
after edition of the favourite emblematist appeared; with translations
into French 1536, into German 1542, into Spanish and
Italian in 1549, and, if we may credit Ames’ <cite>Antiquities of
Printing</cite>, Herbert’s edition, p. 1570, into English in 1551. The
total number of the editions during that period was certainly not
less than 130, of seventy of which a pretty close examination
has been made by the writer of this sketch. The list of editions,
as far as completed, numbers up about 150, and manifests a
persistence in popularity that has seldom been attained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The earliest French translator was John Lefevre, an ecclesiastic,
born at Dijon in 1493,—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Emblemes de Maistre Andre
Alciat</cite></span>: Paris, 1536. He was secretary to Cardinal Givry,
whose protection he enjoyed, and died in 1565. Bartholomew
Aneau, himself an emblematist, was the next translator into
French, 1549; and a third, Claude Mignault, appeared in 1583.
Wolfgang Hunger, a Bavarian, in 1542,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a> and Jeremiah Held
of Nördlingen, were the German translators; Bernardino Daza
Pinciano, in 1549, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Los Emblemas de Alciato</cite></span>, was the Spanish;
and Giovanni Marquale, in 1547, the Italian,—<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Diverse Imprese</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The notes and comments upon Alciat’s Emblems manifest
great research and very extensive learning. Sebastian Stockhamer
supplied <em>commentariola</em>, short comments, to the Lyons
edition of 1556. Francis Sanctius, or Sanchez, one of the
restorers of literature in Spain, born in 1523, also added <em>commentaria</em>
to the Lyons edition of 1573. Above all we must
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>name Claude Mignault, whose praise is that “to a varied
learning he joined a rare integrity.” He was born near Dijon
about 1536, and died in 1606. His comments in full appeared in
Plantin’s<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Antwerp edition, 8vo, of 1573, and may be appealed
to in proof of much patient research and extensive erudition.
Lorenzo Pignoria, born at Padua in 1571, and celebrated for his
study of Egyptian antiquities, also compiled notes on Alciat’s
Emblems in <span class='fss'>MDCXIIX</span>.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a> The results of the labours of the three,
Sanchez, Mignault, and Pignorius, were collected in the Padua
editions of 1621 and 1661. It is scarcely possible that so many
editions should have issued from the press, and so much
learning have been bestowed, without the knowledge of Alciat’s
Emblems having penetrated every nook and corner of the
literary world.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a glance only at the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Prognosticatio</span>,”</span> of Theophrastus
Paracelsus, the alchemist and enthusiast, written in
1536, and expressed in thirty-two copperplates, we pass at once
to the <cite>Dance of Death</cite>, by Hans Holbein, which Bewick, 1789,
and Douce, 1833, in London, and Schlotthauer and Fortoul,
1832, in Munich and Paris, have made familiar to English,
German, and French readers. Of Holbein himself, it is sufficient
here to say that he was born at Bâle in 1495, and died in
London in 1543.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Corser’s copy of the first edition of the <cite>Dance of Death</cite>,
and which was the gift of Francis Douce, Esq., to Edward
Vernon Utterson, supplies the following title, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Les simulachres
&amp; Historiees faces de la Mort</span>, avtant elegammēt
pourtraictes, que artificiellement imaginées: A Lyon, soubz
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>l’escu de Coloigne, <span class='fss'>M.D.XXXVIII</span>.”</span> The volume is a small quarto
of 104 pages, unnumbered, dedicated to Madame Johanna de
Touszele, the Reverend Abbess of the convent of Saint Peter at
Lyons. There are forty-one emblems, each headed by a text
of scripture from the Latin version; the devices follow, with a
French stanza of four lines to each; and there are sundry
Dissertations by Jean de Vauzelles, an eminent divine and
scholar of the same city. But who can speak of the beauty of
the work? The designs by Holbein are many of them wonderfully
conceived,—the engravings by Hans Lützenberge, or
Leutzelburger, as admirably executed.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Rapidly was the work transferred into Latin and Italian, and
before the end of the century at least fifteen editions had issued
from the presses of Lyons, Bâle, and Cologne.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely less celebrated are Holbein’s <cite>Historical Figures
of the Old Testament</cite>, which Sibald Beham’s had preceded in
Francfort by only two years. Beham’s whole series of Bible
Figures are contained in 348 prints, and were published between
1536 and 1540. Dibdin’s <cite>Decameron</cite>, vol. i. pp. 176, 177, will
supply a full account of Holbein’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Historiarum Veteris Instrumenti
icones ad vivum expressæ una cum brevi, sed quoad
fieri potuit, dilucida earundem expositione:”</span> Lyons, small 4to,
1538. The edition of Frellonius, Lyons, 1547, is a very close
reprint of the second edition, and from this it appears that the
work is contained in fifty-two leaves, unnumbered, and that
there are ninety-four devices, which are admirable specimens of
wood-engraving. The first four are from the <cite>Dance of Death</cite>,
but the others appropriate to the subjects, each being accompanied
by a French stanza of four lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Spanish translation was issued in 1543; and in 1549, at
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>Lyons, an English version, “The Images of the Old Testament,
lately expressed, set forthe in Ynglishe and Frenche, vuith a
playn and brief exposition.” All the editions of the century
were about twelve.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hans Brosamer, of Fulda, laboured in the same mine, and
between 1551 and 1553, copying chiefly from Holbein and
Albert Durer, produced at Francfort his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<span class="blackletter">Biblische Historien
kunstlich fürgemalet</span>,”</span>—<cite>Bible Histories artistically pictured</cite>
(3 vols. in 1).</p>

<p class='c000'>We will, though somewhat earlier than the exact date,
continue the subject of Bible-Figure Emblem-books by alluding
to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Quadrins historiques de la Bible</cite></span>,—“Historic Picture-frames
of the Bible,”—for the most part engraved by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le Petit
Bernard,”</span> <em>alias</em> Solomon Bernard, who was born at Lyons in
1512. Of these works in French, English, Spanish, Italian,
Latin, Flemish, and German, there were twenty-two editions
printed between 1553 and 1583. Their general nature may be
known from the fact that to each Scripture subject there is a
device, in design and execution equally good, and that it is
followed or accompanied by a Latin, Italian, &amp;c. stanza, as the
case may be. In the Italian version, Lyons, 1554, the Old
Testament is illustrated by 222 engravings, and the New by
ninety-five.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first of the series appears to be <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Quadrins historiques du
Genèse</cite></span>, Lyons, 1553; followed in the same year by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Quadrins
historiques de l’Exode</cite></span>. There is also of the same date (see
Brunet, iv. c. 996), “The true and lyuely historyke Pvrtreatures
of the woll Bible (with the arguments of eache figure, translated
into english metre by Peter Derendel): Lyons; by Jean of
Tournes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To conclude, there were <cite>Figures of the Bible</cite>, illustrated by
French stanzas, and also by Italian and by German; published
at Lyons and at Venice between 1564 and 1582. (See Brunet’s
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manuel</cite></span>, ii. c. 1255.) Also Jost Amman, at Francfort, in 1564;
and Virgil Solis, from 1560 to 1568, contributed to German
works of the same character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two names of note among emblematists crown the years
1539 and 1540, both in Paris: they are William de la Perrière,
and Giles Corrozet; of the former we know little more than
that he was a native of Toulouse, and dedicated his chief work
to “Margaret of France, Queen of Navarre, the only sister
of the very Christian King of France;” and of the latter,
that, born in Paris in 1510, and dying there in 1568, he was
a successful printer and bookseller, and distinguished (see
Brunet’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manuel</cite></span>, ii. cc. 299–308) for a large number of works
on History, Antiquities, and kindred subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>La Perrière’s chief Emblem-work is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Le Theatre des bons
Engins, auquel sont contenus cent Emblemes</cite></span>: Paris, 8vo, 1539.
There are 110 leaves and really 101 emblems, each device
having a pretty border. His other Emblem-works are—<cite>The
Hundred Thoughts of Love</cite>, 1543, with woodcuts to each page;
<cite>Thoughts on the Four Worlds</cite>, “namely, the divine, the angelic,
the heavenly, and the sensible,” Lyons, 1552; and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>La
Morosophie</span>,”</span>—<cite>The Wisdom of Folly</cite>,—containing a hundred
moral emblems, illustrated by a hundred stanzas of four lines,
both in Latin and in French.</p>

<p class='c000'>Corrozet’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Hecatomgraphie</span>,”</span> Paris, 1540, is a description
of a hundred figures and histories, and contains Apophthegms,
Proverbs, Sentences, and Sayings, as well ancient as modern.
Each page of the 100 emblems is surrounded by a beautiful
border, the devices are neat woodcuts, having the same borders
with La Perrière’s <cite>Theatre of good Contrivances</cite>. There is also
to each a page of explanatory French verses.</p>

<p class='c000'>It requires a stricter inquiry than I have yet been able to
make in order to determine if Corrozet’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Blasons domestiques</cite></span>;
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Blason du Moys de May</cite></span>; and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Tapisserie de l’Eglise chrestienne
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>&amp; catholique</cite></span>, bear a decided emblematical character; the titles
have a taste of emblematism, but are by no means decisive of
the fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>Claude Paradin, the canon of Beaujeu, a small town on the
Ardiere, in the department of the Rhone, published the first
edition of his simple but very interesting <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Devises heroiques</cite></span>,
with 180 woodcuts, at Lyons in 1557. It was afterwards
enlarged by gatherings from Gabriel Symeoni and other writers;
but, either under its own name or that of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Symbola heroica</cite></span>
(edition 1567) was very popular, and before 1600 was printed at
Lyons, Antwerp, Douay, and Leyden, not fewer than twelve
times. The English translation, with which it is generally
admitted that Shakespeare was acquainted, was printed in
London, in 12mo, in 1591, and bears the title, <cite>The Heroicall
Devises of M. Clavdivs Paradin, Canon of Beauieu</cite>, “Whereunto
are added the Lord Gabriel Symeons and others. Translated
out of Latin into English by P.S.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To another Paradin are assigned <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Quadrins historiques de la

which the same publisher issued Spanish, English, Italian,
German, and Flemish versions.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>The rich Emblem Collection at Keir furnishes the first

copy which is now before me, describes the work. It appeared
at Lyons in 1552, and contains 106 emblems, the stanzas to
which, in the Latin edition, are occasionally in Greek, but in the
French edition, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“vers François des Latins et Grecz, par l’auteur
mesme d’iceux.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'>Achille Bocchi, a celebrated Italian scholar, the founder, in
1546, of the Academy of Bologna, Virgil Solis, of Nuremberg,
an artist of considerable repute, Pierre Cousteau, or Costalius, of
Lyons, and Paolo Giovio, an accomplished writer, Bishop of
Nocera, give name to four of the Emblem-books which were
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>issued in the year 1555. That of Bocchius is entitled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Symbolicarvm
Qvaestionvm, libri qvinqve</span>,”</span> Bononiæ, 1555, 4to;
and numbers up 146, or, more correctly, 150 emblems in 340
pages: the devices are the work of Giulio Bonasone, from
copper-plates of great excellence. In 1556, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Bononiæ</cite></span> Sambigucius
put forth <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>In Hermathenam Bocchiam Interpretatio</cite></span>, which
is simply a comment on the 102nd emblem of Bocchius. Virgil
Solis published in 4to, at Nuremberg, the same year, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Libellus</span>
Sartorum, seu Signorum publicorum,”</span>—<cite>A little Book of Cobblers,
or of public Signs</cite>. Cousteau’s “<span class='sc'>Pegma</span>,”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a> which some say appeared
first in 1552, is, as the name denotes, a <em>Structure</em> of
emblems, ninety-five in number, with <em>philosophical narratives</em>,—each
page being surrounded by a pretty border. And Giovio’s
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Dialogo</span> dell’ Imprese Militari et Amore,”</span>—<cite>Dialogue of
Emblems of War and of Love</cite>; or, as it is sometimes named,
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><span class='sc'>Ragionamento</span></span>, <cite>Discourse concerning the words and devices
of arms and of love, which are commonly named Emblems</cite>,”—is
probably the first regular treatise on the subject which had yet
appeared, and which attained high popularity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its estimation in England is shown by the translation which
was issued in London in 1585, entitled, “<span class='sc'>The</span> Worthy tract of
Paulus Iouius, contayning a Discourse of rare inuentions, both
Militarie and Amorous, <em>called Imprese. Whereunto is added</em> a
Pre<em>face</em> <em>contay</em>-ning the Arte of composing them, with <em>many
other notable deuises</em>. <em>By Samuell Daniell late Student</em> in
Oxenforde.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Intimately connected with Giovio’s little work, indeed often
constituting parts of the same volume, were Ruscelli’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Discorso</span>”</span>
on the same subject, Venice, 1556; and Domenichi’s
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Ragionamento</span>,”</span> also at Venice, in 1556. From the testimony
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>of Sir Egerton Brydges (<cite>Res Lit.</cite>), “Ruscelli was one of
the first literati of his time, and was held in esteem by princes
and all ranks of people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Very frequently, too, in combination with Giovio’s Dialogue
on Emblems, are to be found Ruscelli’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Imprese illvstri</span>,”</span>
Venice, 1566; or Symeoni’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Imprese heroiche et morali</span>,”</span>
Lyons, 1559; and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Sententiose Imprese</span>,”</span> Lyons,
1562.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roville’s Lyons edition, of 1574, thus unites in one title-page
Giovio, Symeoni, and Domenichi, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Dialogo Dellimprese
militari et amorose</span>, De Monsignor Giouio Vescouo
di Nocera <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Et del S. Gabriel Symeoni Fiorentino</cite></span>, Con vn
ragionamento di M. Lodouico Domenichi, nel medesimo soggetto.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'>Taking together all the editions in Italian, French, and
Spanish, of these four authors, single or combined, which I have
had the opportunity of examining, there are no less than <em>twenty-two</em>
between 1555 and 1585, besides five or six other editions
named by Brunet in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manuel du Libraire</cite></span>. Roville’s French
edition, 4to, Lyons, 1561, is by Vasquin Philieul, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Dialogve des
Devises d’Armes et d’Amovrs dv S. Pavlo Iovio, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Auec vn
Discours de M. Loys Dominique</cite></span>—et <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>les Deuises Heroiques et
Morales du Seigneur Gabriel Symeon</cite></span>.”</span></p>

<p class='c007'>At this epoch we enter upon ground which has been
skilfully upturned and cultivated by Claude Francis Menestrier,
born at Lyons in 1631, and “distinguished by his
various works on heraldry, decorations, public ceremonials,
&amp;c.” (Aikin’s <cite>Gen. Biog.</cite> vii. p. 41.) In his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Philosophia
Imaginum</span>,”</span>—<cite>Philosophy of Images</cite>,—an octavo volume of 860
pages, published at Amsterdam, 1695, he gives, in ninety-four
pages, a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Judicium</span>,”</span> <em>i.e.</em>, <em>a judgment respecting all authors who

<p class='c000'>Excluding the editions before enumerated, the books of
emblems which I have noted from various sources as assigned to
the authors in the above lists from Menestrier, amount to from
<em>twenty-five</em> to <em>thirty</em>, with the titles of which there is no occasion
to trouble the reader.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning from this digression, Vincenzo Cartari should next
be named in order of time. At Venice, in 1556, appeared his
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Imagini Dei</span> <cite>Dei degli Antichi</cite>,”</span>—<cite>Images of the Gods of the
Ancients</cite>,—4to, of above 500 pages. It contains an account of
the Idols, Rites, Ceremonies, and other things appertaining to
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>the old Religions. It was a work often reprinted, and in 1581
translated into French by Antoine du Verdier, the same who,
in 1585, gave in folio a Catalogue of all who have written or
translated into French up to that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>A folio of 1100 pages, which within the period of our sketch
was reprinted four times, issued from Bâle in 1556; it is,
“<span class='sc'>Hieroglyphica</span>,”—<cite>Hieroglyphics</cite>, or, <cite>Commentaries on the
Sacred Literature of the Egyptians</cite>,—by John Pierius Valerian, a
man of letters, born in extreme poverty at Belluno in 1477, and
untaught the very elements of learning until he was fifteen.
(Aikin’s <cite>Gen. Biog.</cite> ix. 537.) He died in 1558. As an exposition
of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, his very learned work is little
esteemed; but it contains emblems innumerable, comprised in
fifty-eight books, each book dedicated to a person of note, and
treating one class of objects. The devices—small woodcuts—amount
to 365.</p>

<p class='c000'>Etienne Jodelle, a poet, equally versatile whether in Latin or
in French, was skilled in the ancient languages, and acquainted
with the arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture, as well as
dexterous in the use of arms. He published, in 1558, a thin
quarto <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Recueil</span>,”</span> or <cite>Collection</cite> of the inscriptions, figures,
devices, and masks ordained in Paris at the Hôtel de Ville.
The same year, and again in 1569 and 1573, appeared the large
folio volume, in five parts, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Austriacis Gentis Imagines</span>,”</span>—<cite>Portraits
of the Austrian family</cite>,—full lengths, engraved by
Gaspar ab Avibus, of Padua. At the foot of each portrait are a
four-lined stanza, a brief biographical notice, and some emblematical
figure. Of similar character, though much inferior as a
work of art, is Jean Nestor’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span class='sc'>Histoire</span> <em>des Hommes illustres de
la Maison de Medici</em></span>; a quarto of about 240 leaves, printed at
Paris in 1564. (See the Keir <cite>Catalogue</cite>, p. 143.) It contains
“twelve woodcuts of the emblems of the different members of
the House of Medici.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>Hoffer’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Icones catecheseos</span>,”</span> or <em>Pictures of instruction</em>,
and of virtues and vices, illustrated by verses, and also by
seventy-eight figures or woodcuts, was printed at Wittenberg in
1560. The next year, 1561—if not in 1556 (see Brunet’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manuel</cite></span>, vol. ii. cc. 930, 931)—John Duvet, one of the earliest
engravers on copper in France, at Lyons, published in twenty-four
plates, folio, his chief work, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Lapocalypse figuree</span>;”</span>
and in 1562, at Naples, the Historian of Florence, Scipione
Ammirato, gave to the world <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Il Rota overo dell’ Imprese</span>,”</span>
or, <cite>Dialogue of the Sig. Scipione Ammirato</cite>, in which he
discourses of many emblems of divers excellent authors, and of
some rules and admonitions concerning this subject written to
the Sig. Vincenzo Carrafa.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were it less a subject of debate between Dutch and German
critics as to the exact character of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<span class='sc'>Spelen van sinne</span>,”</span><a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
which were published by the Chambers of Rhetoric at Ghent in
1539, and by those of Antwerp in 1561 and 1562 (see Brunet’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manuel</cite></span>, vol. v. c. 484), we should claim these works for our
Emblem domain. But whether claimed or not, the exhibitions
and amusements of the Chambers of Rhetoric, especially at
their great gatherings in the chief cities of the Netherlands, were
often very lively representations by action and accessory devices
of dramatic thought and sentiment, from “King Herod and his
Deeds,” “enacted in the Cathedral of Utrecht in 1418,” to what
Motley, in his <cite>Dutch Republic</cite>, vol. i. p. 80, terms the “magnificent
processions, brilliant costumes, living pictures, charades,
and other animated, glittering groups,”—“trials of dramatic and
poetic skill, all arranged under the superintendence of the
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>particular association which in the preceding year had borne
away the prize.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Rhetorical Chambers existed in the most obscure
villages” (Motley, i. p. 79); and had regular constitutions, being
presided over by officers with high-sounding titles, as kings,
princes, captains, and archdeacons,—and each having “its
peculiar title or blazon, as the Lily, the Marigold, or the Violet,
with an appropriate motto.” After 1493 they were “incorporated
under the general supervision of an upper or mother-society
of Rhetoric, consisting of fifteen members, and called by
the title of ‘Jesus with the balsam flower.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>As I have been informed by Mr. Hessells, Siegenbeek, in his
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Geschiedenis der Nederlandsche Letterkunde</cite></span>, says,—“Besides the
ordinary meetings of the Chambers, certain poetical feasts were
in vogue among the Rhetor-gevers, whereby one or other subject,
to be responded to in burdens or short songs (<em>liedekens</em>), according
to the contents of the card, was announced, with the
promise of prizes to those who would best answer the proposed
question. But the so-called <cite>Entries</cite> deserve for their magnificence,
and the diversity of poetical productions which they give
rise to, especially our attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It happened from time to time that one or other of the most
important Chambers sent a card in rhyme to the other Chambers
of the same province, whereby they were invited to be at a
given time in the town where the senders of the card were
established, for the sake of the celebration of a poetical feast.
This card contained further everything by which it was desired
that the Chambers, which were to make their appearance, should
illustrate this feast, viz., the performance of an allegorical play
(<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"><em>zinnespel</em></span>) in response to some given question;<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a> the preparation
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>esbatementez</cite></span> (drawings), <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"><em>facéties</em></span> (jests), prologues; the
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>execution of splendid entries and processions; the exhibitions of
beautifully painted coats of arms, &amp;c. These entries were of
two kinds, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"><em>landiuweelen</em></span>, and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"><em>haagspelen</em></span>>;—the <em>landjewels</em> were
the most splendid, and were performed in towns; the <em>hedge-plays</em>
belonged properly to villages, though sometimes in towns
these followed the performance of a landjewel.” Originally,
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"><em>landjewel</em></span> meant a prize of honour of the land; called also
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"><em>landprys</em></span> (land-prize).</p>

<p class='c000'>Such were the periodic jubilees of a neighbouring people,
their “land-jewels,” as they were termed, when the birthtime of
our greatest English dramatist arrived. And as we mark the
wide and increasing streams of the Emblem Literature flowing
over every European land, and how the common tongue of
Rome gave one language to all Christendom, can we deem it
probable that any man of genius, of discernment, and of only
the usual attainments of his compeers, would live by the side of
these streams and never dip his finger into the waters, nor wet
even the soles of his feet where the babbling emblems flowed?</p>

<p class='c000'>Some there have been to maintain that Shakespeare had
visited the Netherlands, or even resided there; and it is consequently
within the limits of no unreasonable conjecture that he
had seen the <em>landjewels</em> distributed, and at the sight felt himself
inspirited to win a nobler fame.</p>

IN the year at which this Section begins,
Shakespeare was born, and for a whole
century the Emblem tide never ebbed.
There was an uninterrupted succession of
new writers and of new editions. Many
eminent names have appeared in the past,
and names as eminent will adorn the future.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fifty years which remain to the period comprised within
the limits of this Sketch of Emblem Literature we divide into
two portions of twenty-five years each: 1st, up to 1590, when
Shakespeare had fairly entered on his dramatic career; and
2nd, from 1590 to 1615, when, according to Steevens (edition
1785, vol. i. p. 354), his labours had ended with <cite>The Twelfth
Night, or, What You Will</cite>. As far as actual correspondences
between Shakespeare and the Emblem Writers demand, our
Sketch might finish with 1610, or even earlier: for some time
will of necessity intervene, after a work has been issued, before
it will modify the thoughts of others, or enter into the phrases
which they employ. However, there is nothing very incongruous
in making this Sketch and the last of Shakespeare’s
dramas terminate with the same date.</p>

<h4 id='sec2.4.1' class='c023'></h4>
<p class='c003'>I.—In 1564, at Rome, in 4to, the distinguished Latinist,
Gabriel Faerno’s Fables were first printed, 100 in number;—it
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>was three years after his death. The plates are from designs
which Titian is said to have drawn. Our English Whitney
adopts several of Faerno’s Fables among his Emblems, and on
this authority we class them with books of Emblems. From
time to time, as late as to 1796, new editions and translations of
the Fables have been issued. A copy in the Free Library,
Manchester, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Romæ Vincentius Luchinus, 1565,”</span> bears the
title, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Fabvlae Centvm ex antiqvis avctoribvs delectae, et a Gabriele
Faerno, Cremonensi carminibvs explicatae</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Virgil Solis, a native of Nuremberg, where he was born in
1514, and where he died in 1570; and Jost Amman, who was
born at Zurich in 1539, but passed his life at Nuremberg, and
died there in 1591, were both artists of high repute, and contributed
to the illustration of Emblem-works. The former,
between 1560 and 1568, produced 125 <cite>New Figures for the New
Testament</cite>, and <cite>An Artistic little Book of Animals</cite>; and the
latter, from 1564 to 1586, contributed very largely to books of
<cite>Biblical Figures</cite>, of “Animals,” of “Genealogies,” of “Heraldry,”
and of the <em>Habits</em> and <em>Costumes</em> of All Ranks of the <em>Clergy of
the Roman Church</em>, and of <em>Women</em> of every “Condition, profession,
<em>and age</em>,” throughout the nations of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the press of Christopher Plantin, of Antwerp, there
issued nearly fifty editions of Emblem-books between 1564 and
1590. Of these, one of the earliest was, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Emblemata cvm
aliqvot Nvmmis antiqvis</span>,”</span>—<cite>Emblems with some ancient
Coins</cite>,—4to, 1564, by the Hungarian, John Sambucus, born at
Tornau in 1531. A French version, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Emblemes de Jehan
Sambucus</cite></span>, issued from the same press in 1567. Among
Emblematists, none bears a fairer name as “physician, antiquary,
and poet.” According to De Bry’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Icones</cite></span>, pt. iii., ed.
1598, pp. 76–83, he obtained the patronage of two emperors,

of counsellor of state and historian of the empire. To him also
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>belonged the rare honour of having his work commented on by
one of the great heroes of Christendom, Don John of Austria,
in 1572.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Songes drolatiqves de Pantagrvel</cite></span>, by Rabelais, appeared
at Paris in 1565, but its emblematical character has been

which the first edition appeared in 1565, and justly claims to be

this period.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these works, Vander Noot’s was translated into English,
says Brunet, (v. c. 1072,) by Henry Bynneman, 1569, and is
remarkable for containing (see <cite>Ath. Cantab.</cite> ii. p. 258) certain
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>poems, termed sonnets, and epigrams, which Spenser wrote
before his sixteenth year. Mademoiselle Georgette de Montenay
was a French lady of noble birth, and dedicated her 100
Emblems “to the very illustrious and virtuous Princesse,
Madame Jane D’Albret, Queen of Navarre.” Chartier, a
painter and engraver, flourished about 1574; L’Anglois is not
mentioned in the <cite>Hieroglyphics</cite> of Dr. Leemans, nor do I find
any notice of Messin.</p>

works, many of them of high scholarship, occupies eight pages in
Brunet’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Manuel du Libraire</cite></span>. The name of Beza is of similar
renown;—both Etienne and he had to seek safety from persecution;
and when Etienne’s effigy was being burnt, he pleasantly
said “that he had never felt so cold as on the day when he was
burning.” Laurence Haechtanus was the author of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Parvus
Mundus</cite></span>, 1579, which Gerardt de Jode <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"><em>den liefhebbers der
consten</em></span>, the lover of art, has so admirably adorned. Nicolas
Reusner was a man of extensive learning, to whom the emperor
Rudolph II. decreed the poetic crown. Francis Modius was a
Fleming, a learned jurisconsult and Latinist, who died at Aire
in Artois, in 1597, at the age of sixty-one; Theodore Zuinger
was a celebrated physician of Bâle; and Joachim Camerarius,
born at Nuremberg in 1534, also a celebrated physician, one of
the first to form a botanical garden, “attained high reputation
in his profession, and was consulted for princes and persons of
rank throughout Germany.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An edition of a work reputed to be emblematic belongs to
this period—to 1587; it is the <cite>Physiologist</cite>, by S. Epiphanius,
to whom allusion has been made at p. 28.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tobias Stimmer was an artist, born at Schaffhausen in 1544,
and in conjunction with his younger brother, John Christopher
Stimmer, executed part of the woodcuts in the Bible of Basle,
1576 and 1586. The younger brother also prepared the prints
for a set of Emblems, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Icones Affabræ</cite></span>, published at Strasburg in
1591. Sigismund Feyrabend is a name of great note as a designer,
engraver on wood, and bookseller, at Francfort, towards
the end of the sixteenth century. Who Martin Schrot was, does
not appear from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Biographie Universelle</cite></span>; and Clamorinus

<p class='c000'>Don Juan Manuel was a descendant of the famous Alphonso
V. His work consists of forty-nine little tales, with a
moral in verse to each. It is regarded, says the <cite>Biog. Univ.</cite>
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>vol. xxvi. p. 541, “as the finest monument of Spanish literature
in the sixteenth century.” There are earlier editions of Francisco
de Guzman’s <cite>Moral Triumphs</cite>, as at Antwerp in 1557, but
the edition above named claims to be more perfect than the
others. Horozco y Covaruvias was a native of Toledo, and died
in 1608; one of his offices was that of Bishop of Girgenti in
Sicily. In 1601 he translated his Emblems into Latin, and
printed it under the title of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Symbolæ Sacræ</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Henry Bynneman, whose name is placed before the version
of Vander Noot’s <cite>Theatre</cite>, is not known with any certainty to
have been the translator. He was a celebrated printer in
London from about 1566 to 1583. Sir Thomas North, to whose
translation of Plutarch, Shakespeare was largely indebted,
was probably an ancestor of the Lord Keeper of the Great
Seal under Charles II. Samuel Daniell enjoyed considerable
reputation as a poet, and on Spenser’s death in 1598, was
appointed poet-laureate to the Queen. Of Whitney it is known
that he was a scholar of Oxford and of Cambridge, and that his
name appears on the roll of the university of Leyden. He was
a native of Cheshire, and died there in 1601. It may be added
that an edition of Barclay’s <cite>Ship of Fooles</cite> was in 1570
“Imprinted at London in Paules Churchyarde by John Cawood
Printer to the Queenes Maiestie.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, in the period between Shakespeare’s birth and his full
entry on his dramatic career, we have named above sixty
persons, many of great eminence, who amused their leisure, or
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>indulged their taste, by composing books of Emblems; had we
named also the editions of the same authors, within these
twenty-five years, they would have amounted to 156, exclusive
of many reprints from other authors who wrote Emblems
between <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1500 and <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1564.</p>

<h3 id='sec2.4.2' class='c020'></h3>
<p class='c003'>II.—Shakespeare’s Dramatic Career comprises another
period of twenty-five years,—from 1590 to 1615. From the
necessity of the case, indeed, few, if any of the Emblem writers
and compilers towards the end of the time could be known to
him, and any correspondence between them in thoughts or
expressions must have been purely accidental. For the completion
of our Sketch, however, we proceed to the end of the
period we had marked out. And to save space, and, we hope,
to avoid tediousness, we will continue the tabulated form
adopted in the last Section.</p>

Latin, Dutch, Spanish, German, and English, is alphabetically
arranged, and treats of nearly 800 different subjects, with about
200 devices. Otho van Veen, or Vænius, belongs to Holland,
not to Italy,—and his name appears here simply because his

<p class='c000'>Peter Vander Borcht, born at Brussels about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1540,
engraved numerous works, and among them 178 prints for this
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>edition of Ovid. The Stimmers have been mentioned before,
p. 90. Jean Mercier, born at Uzès in Languedoc, wrote the
Latin version of the <cite>Hieroglyphics</cite> of Horapollo, Paris, 1548,—but
probably it was his son Josias whose Emblems are mentioned
under the year 1592, and who dates them from Bruges.
Theodore De Bry, born at Liege in 1528 (Bryan, p. 119), carried
on the business of an engraver and bookseller in Francfort,
where he died in 1598. He was greatly assisted by his sons
John Theodore and John Israel. <cite>The Procession of the Knights
of the Garter in 1566</cite>, and that at the <cite>Funeral of Sir Philip
Sidney</cite>, are his workmanship. Nicolas Taurellius was a
student, and afterwards professor of Physic and Medicine in
the University of Altorf in Franconia. An oration of his appears
in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Emblemata Anniversaria</cite></span> of that institution. He was
named “the German Philosopher.” Denis le Bey de Batilly
appears to have been royal president of the Consistory of Metz.
John David, born at Courtray in Flanders, in 1546, entered the
Society of the Jesuits, and was rector of the colleges of Courtray,
Brussels, and Ghent; he died in 1613. Ægidius Sadeler,
known as the Phœnix of engravers, was a native of Antwerp,
born in 1570, the nephew and disciple of the two eminent
engravers John and Raphael Sadeler. He enjoyed a pension
from three successive emperors, Rodolphus II., Matthias, and
Ferdinand II. Of Crispin de Passe, born at Utrecht about 1560,
Bryan (p. 548) says, “He was a man of letters, and not only
industrious to perfect himself in his art, but fond of promoting
it.” His works were numerous, and have examples in the
Emblem-books of his day. Otho van Veen, of a distinguished
family, was born at Leyden in 1556. After a residence of seven
years in Italy, he established himself at Antwerp, and had the
rare claim to celebrity that Rubens became his disciple. In his
Emblem-works the designs were by himself, but the engravings
by his brother Gilbert van Veen. (Bryan, p. 853, 4.) Lawrence
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>Pignorius, born at Padua, 1571, and educated at the Jesuits’
school and the university of that city, gained a high reputation
by several learned works, and especially by those on Egyptian
antiquities. He died of the plague in 1631. The work of
Richard Lubbæus Broecmer, is little more than a reprint of one
by Bernard Furmer, in 1575, <cite>On the Use and Abuse of Wealth</cite>.
Jerome Aleander, nephew of one of Luther’s stoutest opponents,
the Cardinal Aleander, was of considerable literary reputation at
Rome, being a member of the society of Humourists, established
in that city,—his death was in 1631. According to
Oetlinger’s brief notice, <cite>Bibliog. Biograph. Univ.</cite>, Gabriel Rollenhagen,
of Magdeburg, was a German schoolmaster, born in
1542, and dying in 1609; his <cite>Kernel of Emblems</cite> is well illustrated
by Crispin de Passe. The same “excellent engraver”
adorned <cite>The Mirror of Heroes</cite>, founded on Homer’s <cite>Iliad</cite> by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“le
sieur de la Rivière, Isaac Hillaire.”</span> Both Latin and French
verses are appended to the Emblems, and at their end are curious
“Epitaphs on the Heroes who fell in the Trojan war,” too late,
it is to be feared, to afford any gratification to their immediate
friends. To Jacobus à Bruck, surnamed of Angermunde, a town
of Brandenberg, there belongs another Emblem-book, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Emblemata
Politica</cite></span>, Cologne, 1618. In it are briefly demonstrated the
duties which belong to princes; it is dedicated “to his most
merciful Prince and Lord, the Emperor Matthias I., ‘semper
Augusto.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hernando de Soto was auditor and comptroller for the
King of Spain in his house of Castile. At the end are stanzas
of three verses each, in Latin and Spanish on alternate pages,
“to our Lady the Virgin.” Don Sebastian de Couarrubias
Orozco was chaplain to the King of Spain, schoolmaster and
canon of Cuenca, and adviser of the Holy Office. Both Soto and
Orozco dedicate their works to Don Francisco Gomez de Sandoual,
Duke of Lerma. Juan Francisco de Villava dedicates his

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>William Wyrley’s <cite>True use of Arms</cite>, was reprinted in 1853.
In <cite>Censura Lit.</cite>, i. p. 313, Samuel Egerton Brydges gives a
pleasing account of the character of Andrew Willet, whom
Fuller ranks among England’s worthies (vol. i. p. 238). Of John
Crosse himself, nothing is known, but his MS. is certainly
not later than Elizabeth’s reign, for the royal arms, at p. 33,
are of earlier date than the accession of the Stuarts; and the
allusion to the Belgian dames, pp. 2–6, agrees with her times.
The work contains 120 shields and devices, and was lent me by
my very steadfast friend in Emblem lore, Mr. Corser of Stand.
At pp. 10 and 37, it is said,—</p>

      <div class='line'>“In Troynovant a famous schoole was founde</div>

      <div class='line'>With Mulcaster, whose fame shall never fade.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now it was in 1561 Richard Mulcaster, of King’s College,
Cambridge, and of Christchurch, Oxford, was appointed head
master of Merchant-Taylor’s School in London, then just
founded. (Warton, iii. 282.) Thus it is shown to be very
probable that <cite>Crosse his Covert</cite> may take date not later than
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1600. It may be added that at the end of the MS. the
figure of Fortune, or Occasion, on a wheel, is almost a fac-simile
from Whitney’s Device, p. 181, which was itself struck from the
block (Emb. 121. p. 438) of Plantin’s edition of Alciatus,
<span class='fss'>MDLXXXI</span>. John Guillim’s work on <cite>Heraldry</cite> passed through
five editions previous to that of Capt. John Logan, in 1724; the
original folio is one of the book-treasures at Keir. Henry
Peacham, <em>M<sup>r</sup>. of Artes</em>, as he terms himself, was a native of
Leverton in Holland, in the county of Lincoln, and a student
under “the right worshipfull Mr. D. Laifeild,” in Trinity College,
Cambridge. He has dedicated his work “to the Right High
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>and Mightie Henrie, Eldest Sonne of our Soveraigne Lord the
King.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Singular it is, that except the MS. which belonged to the late
Joseph B. Yates, of Liverpool, there is not known to exist any
translation into English of the once famous <cite>Emblems of
Alciatus</cite>. That MS. (see <cite>Transact. Liverpool L. and P. Society,
Nov. 5, 1849</cite>) “appears to be of the time of James the First.”
The Devices are drawn and coloured, and have considerable
resemblance to those in Rapheleng’s edition of Alciatus, 1608.
As a specimen we add the translation of Emblem <span class='fss'>XXXIII.</span>
p. 39, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Signa fortium.”</span></p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How pleasant to feel that this Sketch of Emblem-books and
their authors, previous to and during the times of Shakespeare,
has been brought to an end. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Vina coronant,”</span> <em>fill a bumper</em>,
“let the sparkling glass go round.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The difficulty really has been to compress. The materials
collected were most abundant. From curiously or artistically
arranged title pages,—from various dedications,—from devices
admirably designed or of wondrous oddity,—and from the
countless collateral subjects among which the Emblem writers
and their commentators disported themselves, the temptations
were so rich to wander off here and there, that it was necessary
continually to remember that it was a veritable sketch I was
engaged on and not a universal history. I lashed myself therefore
to the mast and sailed through a whole sea of syrens, deaf,
though they charmed ever so sweetly to make me sing with
them of emperors and kings, of popes and cardinals, of the
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>learned and the gay, who appeared to believe that everyone’s
literary salvation depended on the contrivance of a device and
the interpretation of an emblem.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had I known where to refer my readers for a general view of
my subject, either brief or prolix, I should have spared myself the
labour of compiling one. The results are, that, previous to the year
1616, the Emblem Literature of Europe could claim for its own
at least 200 authors, not including translators, and that above
770 editions of original texts and of versions had issued from
the press.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>If Shakespeare knew nothing of so wide-spread a literature it
is very wonderful; and more wondrous far, if knowing, he did
not inweave some of the threads into the very texture of his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this Sketch of Emblem writers, it will be perceived,
though their names are seldom heard of except among the
antiquaries of letters, that, as a class, they were men of deep
erudition, of considerable natural power, and of large attainments.
To the literature of their age they were as much
ornaments as to the literature of our modern times are the
works, illustrated or otherwise, with which our hours of leisure
are wont to be both amused and instructed. No one who is
ignorant of them can possess a full idea of the intellectual
treasures of the more cultivated nations of Europe about the
period of which the works of Alciatus and of Giovio are the
types. We may be learned in its controversies, well read in
its ecclesiastical and political history, intimate even with the
characters and pursuits of its great statesmen and sovereigns,
and strong as well as enlightened in our admiration of its
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>painters, statuaries, poets, and other artistic celebrities, but we
are not baptized into its perfect spirit unless we know what
entertainment and refreshing there were for men’s minds when
serious studies were intermitted and the weighty cares and
business of life for a while laid aside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Take up these Emblem writers as great statesmen and
victorious commanders did; read them as did the recluse in his
study and the man of the world at his recreation; search into
them as some did for good morals suitable to the guidance of
their lives, and as others did for snatches of wit and learning
fitted to call forth their merriment; and see, amid divers
conceits and many quaintnesses, and not a few inanities and
vanities, how richly the fancy was indulged, and how freely the
play of genius was allowed; and then will you be better
prepared to estimate the whole literature of the nations of that
busy, stirring time, when authorities were questioned that had
reigned unchallenged for centuries, and men’s minds were
awakened to all the advantages of learning, and their tastes
formed for admiring the continually varying charms of the
poet’s song and the artist’s skill.</p>

<p class='c000'>True; those strange turns of thought, those playings upon
mere words, those fanciful dreamings, those huntings up and
down of some unfortunate idea through all possible and impossible
doublings and windings, are not approved either by a purer
taste, or by a better-trained judgment. We have outgrown the
customs of those logo-maniacs, or word-worshippers, whom old
Ralph Cudworth, in his <cite>True Intellectual System of the Universe</cite>,
p. 67, seems to have had in view, when he affirms, “that they
could not make a Rational Discourse of anything, though never
so small, but they must stuff it with their Quiddities, Entities,
Essences, Hæcceities, and the like.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But at the revival of literature, when the ancient learning
was devoured without being digested, and the modern investigations
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>were not always controlled by sound discretion,—when the
child was as a giant, and the giant disported himself in fantastic
gambols,—we must not wonder that compositions, both prose
and poetic, were perpetrated which receive unhesitatingly from
the higher criticism the sentence of condemnation. But in
condemning let not the folly be committed of despising and
undervaluing. We may devotedly love our more advanced
civilization, our finer sensibilities, and our juster estimate of
what true taste for the beautiful demands, and yet we may
accord to our leaders and fathers in learning and refinement the
no unworthy commendation, that, with their means and in their
day, they gave a mighty onward movement to those literary
pursuits and pleasures in which the powers of the fancy heighten
the glow of our joy, and the resources of accurate knowledge
bestow an abiding worth upon our intellectual labours.</p>

AMONG some warm admirers of Shakespeare
it has not been unusual to depreciate
his learning for the purpose of
exalting his genius. It is thought that
intuition and inborn power of mind
accomplished for him what others, less
favoured by the inspiration of the all-directing
Wisdom, could scarcely effect
by their utmost and life-patient labours. The worlds of nature
and of art were spread before him, and out of the materials,
with perfect ease, he fashioned new creations, calling into
existence forms of beauty and grace, and investing them at will
with the rare attributes of poetic fancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the very surface, however, of Shakespeare’s writings, in
the subjects of his dramas and in the structure of their respective
plots, though we may not find a perfectly accurate scholarship,
we have ample evidence that the choicest literature of his native
land, and, through translations at least, the ample stores of
Greece and of Italy were open to his mind. Whether his scenes
be the plains of Troy, the river of Egypt, the walls of Athens, or
the capitol of Rome, his learning is amply sufficient for the
occasion; and though the critic may detect incongruities and
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>errors,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a> they are probably not greater than those which many a
finished scholar falls into when he ventures to describe the
features of countries and cities which he has not actually visited.
The heroes and heroines of pagan mythology and pagan
history, the veritable actors in ancient times of the world’s great
drama,—or the more unreal characters of fairy land, of the
weird sisterhood, and of the wizard fraternity,—these all stand
before us instinct with life.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a> And from the old legends of
Venice, of Padua and Verona,—from the traditionary lore of
England, of Denmark, and of Scotland,—or from the more
truth-like delineations of his strictly historical plays, we may of
a certainty gather, that his reading was of wide extent, and that
with a student’s industry he made it subservient to the illustration
and faithfulness of poetic thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trusting, as we may do in a very high degree, to Douce’s
<cite>Illustrations of Shakspeare and of Ancient Manners</cite> (2 vols.,
London, 1807), or to the still more elaborate and erudite work
of Dr. Nathan Drake, <cite>Shakspeare and his Times</cite> (2 vols., 4to,
London, 1817), we need not hesitate at resting on Mr. Capel
Lofft’s conclusion, that Shakespeare possessed “a very reasonable
portion of Latin; he was not wholly ignorant of Greek; he
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>had a knowledge of French, so as to read it with ease; and I
believe not less of the Italian. He was habitually conversant
with the chronicles of his country. He lived with wise and
highly cultivated men, with Jonson, Essex, and Southampton,
in familiar friendship.” (See Drake, vol. i. pp. 32, 33, <em>note</em>.)
And again, “It is not easy, with due attention to his poems, to
doubt of his having acquired, when a boy, no ordinary facility
in the <em>classic</em> language of Rome; though his knowledge of it
might be small, comparatively, to the knowledge of that great
and indefatigable scholar, Ben Jonson.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Drake and Mr. Capel Lofft differ in opinion, though not
very widely, as to the extent of Shakespeare’s knowledge of
Italian literature. The latter declares, “My impression is, that
Shakespeare was not unacquainted with the most popular
authors in <em>Italian prose</em>, and that his ear had listened to the
enchanting tones of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Petrarca</cite></span>, and some others of their great
poets.” And the former affirms, that “From the evidence which
his genius and his works afford, his acquaintance with the
French and Italian languages was not merely confined to the
picking up <em>a familiar phrase or two</em> from the conversation or
writings of others, but that he had actually commenced, and at
an early period too, the study of these languages, though, from
his situation, and the circumstances of his life, he had neither
the means, nor the opportunity, of cultivating them to any
considerable extent.” (See Drake, vol. i. pp. 54, <em>note</em>, and
57, 58.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Now the Emblem-writers of the sixteenth century, and
previously, made use chiefly of the Latin, Italian, and French
languages. Of the Emblem-books in Spanish, German, Flemish,
Dutch, and English, only the last would be available for Shakespeare’s
benefit, except for the suggestions which the engravings
and woodcuts might supply. It is then well for us to understand
that his attainments with respect to language were
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>sufficient to enable him to study this branch of literature, which
before his day, and in his day, was so widely spread through all
the more civilized countries of Europe. He possessed the
mental apparatus which gave him power, should inclination or
fortune lead him there, to cultivate the <em>viridiaria</em>, the pleasant
blooming gardens of emblem, device, and symbol.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even if he had not been able to read the Emblem writers in
their original languages, undoubtedly he would meet with their
works in the society in which he moved and among the learned
of his native land. As we have seen, he was in familiar friendship
with the Earl of Essex. To that nobleman Willet, in 1598,
had dedicated his <cite>Sacred Emblems</cite>. Of men of Devereux’s
stamp, several had become acquainted with the Emblem Literature.
To his rival, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester,
Whitney devoted the <cite>Choice of Emblemes</cite>, 1586; in 1580, Beza
had honoured the young James of Scotland with the foremost
place in his <cite>Portraits of Illustrious Men</cite>, to which a set of
Emblems were appended; Sir Philip Sidney, during his journey
on the continent, 1571–1575, became acquainted with the
works of the Italian emblematist, Ruscelli; and as early as
1549, it was “to the very illustrious Prince James earl of Arran
in Scotland,” that “Barptolemy Aneau” commended his French
version of Alciat’s classic stanzas.</p>

<p class='c007'>And were it not a fact, as we can show it to be, that Shakespeare
quotes the very mottoes and describes the very drawings
which the Emblem-books contain, we might, from his highly
cultivated taste in other respects, not unreasonably conclude
that he must both have known them and have used them. His
information and exquisite judgment extended to works of
highest art,—to sculpture, painting, and music, as well as to
literature. There is, perhaps, no description of statuary extant
so admirable for its truth and beauty as the lines quoted by
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>Drake, p. 617, from the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite>,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a> “where Paulina unveils

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This exquisite piece of statuary is ascribed by Shakespeare
(<cite>Winter’s Tale</cite>, act v. sc. 2, l. 8, vol. iii. p. 420) to “that rare
Italian master Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity, and
could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her
custom, so perfectly is he her ape: he so near to Hermione
hath done Hermione, that they say one would speak to her, and
stand in hope of answer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>According to Kugler’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<span class='sc'>Geschichte der Malerei</span>,”</span>—<cite>History
of Painting</cite> (Berlin, 1847, vol. i. p. 641),—Julio Romano
was one of the most renowned of Raphael’s scholars, born about
1492, and dying in 1546. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Giulio war ein Künstler von
rüstigem, lebendig, bewegtem, keckem Geiste, begabt mit einer
Leichtigkeit der Hand, welche den kühnen und rastlosen
Bildern seiner Phantasie überall Leben und Dasein zu geben
wusste.”</span><a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>His earlier works are to be found at Rome, Genoa, and Dresden.
Soon after Raphael’s death he was employed in Mantua
both as an architect and a painter; and here exist some of his
choice productions, as the Hunting by Diana, the frescoes of the
Trojan War, the histories of Psyche, and other Love-tales of the
gods. Pictures by him are scattered over Europe,—some at
Venice, some in the sacristy of St. Peter’s, and in other places in
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>Rome; some in the Louvre, and some in the different collections
of England,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a> as the Jupiter among the Nymphs and Corybantes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether any of his works were in England during the reign of
Elizabeth, we cannot affirm positively; but as there were “sixteen
by Julio Romano” in the fine collection of paintings at Whitehall,
made, or, rather, increased by Charles I., of which Henry VIII.
had formed the nucleus, it is very probable there were in England
some by that master so early as the writing of the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite>,
or even before, in which, as we have seen, he is expressly named.
It may therefore be reasonably conjectured that in the statue of
Hermione Shakespeare has accurately described some figure
which he had seen in one of Julio Romano’s paintings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same rare appreciation of the beautiful appears in the
<cite>Cymbeline</cite>, act ii. sc. 4, lines 68–74, 81–85, 87–91, vol. ix.
pp. 207, 208, where the poet describes the adornments of Imogen’s
chamber:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“It was hang’d</div>

      <div class='line'>The press of boats, or pride: a piece of work</div>
      <div class='line'>So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive</div>
      <div class='line'>In workmanship and value.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</div>
      <div class='line in19'>And the chimney-piece</div>
      <div class='line'>Chaste Dian, bathing:<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a> never saw I figures</div>
      <div class='line'>So likely to report themselves: the cutter</div>
      <div class='line'>Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,</div>

      <div class='line in19'>The roof o’ the chamber</div>
      <div class='line'>With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons—</div>

      <div class='line'>Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely</div>
      <div class='line'>Depending on their brands.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>So, in the <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite>, act ii. sc. 1, lines 338–348,
vol. iii. p. 45, Gremio enumerates the furniture of his house in
Padua:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“First, as you know, my house within the city</div>
      <div class='line'>Is richly furnished with plate and gold;</div>
      <div class='line'>Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;</div>
      <div class='line'>My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;</div>
      <div class='line'>In ivory coffers I have stuff’d my crowns;</div>
      <div class='line'>In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,</div>
      <div class='line'>Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss’d with pearl,</div>
      <div class='line'>Valance of Venice gold in needlework,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pewter and brass and all things that belong</div>
      <div class='line'>To house or housekeeping.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Hamlet, when he contrasts his father and his uncle,
act iii. sc. 4, lines 55–62, vol. viii. p. 111, what a force of artistic
skill does he not display! It is indeed a poet’s description, but
it has all the power and reality of a most finished picture. The
very form and features are presented, as if some limner, a
perfect master of his pencil, had portrayed and coloured them:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“See what a grace was seated on this brow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</div>
      <div class='line'>A station like the herald Mercury</div>
      <div class='line'>New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;</div>
      <div class='line'>A combination and a form indeed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where every god did seem to set his seal</div>
      <div class='line'>To give the world assurance of a man.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, too, act iii. sc. 2, lines 115–128,
vol. ii. p. 328, when Bassanio opens the leaden casket and discovers
the portrait of Portia, who but one endowed with a
painter’s inspiration could speak of it as Shakespeare does!—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fair Portia’s counterfeit! What demi-god</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>Seem they in motion? Here are sever’d lips,</div>
      <div class='line'>Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar</div>
      <div class='line'>Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs</div>
      <div class='line'>The painter plays the spider, and hath woven</div>
      <div class='line'>A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,</div>
      <div class='line'>Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,—</div>
      <div class='line'>How could he see to do them? Having made one,</div>
      <div class='line'>Methinks it should have power to steal both his</div>
      <div class='line'>And leave itself unfurnish’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Such power of estimating artistic skill authorises the supposition
that Shakespeare himself had made the painter’s art a
subject of more than accidental study; else whence such expressions
as those which in the <cite>Antony</cite>, act ii. sc. 2, lines 201–209,
vol. ix. p. 38, are applied to Cleopatra?—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“For her own person.</div>
      <div class='line'>It beggar’d all description: she did lie</div>
      <div class='line'>In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue,</div>

      <div class='line'>The fancy outwork nature: on each side her</div>

<p class='c000'>Or, even when sportively, in <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>, act i. sc. 5, lines
214–230, vol. iii. p. 240, Olivia replies to Viola’s request,
“Good Madam, let me see your face,”—is it not quite in an
artist’s or an amateur’s style that the answer is given? “We
will draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir,
such a one I was this present: is’t not well done?” [<em>Unveiling</em>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Viol.</em> Excellently done, if God did all.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Oli.</em> ’Tis in grain, sir; ’twill endure wind and weather.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span><em>Oli.</em> O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules
of my beauty: it shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labelled

<p class='c000'>But from certain lines in the <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite> (Induction,
sc. 2, lines 47–58), it is evident that Shakespeare had seen
either some of the mythological pictures by Titian, or engravings
from them, or from similar subjects. Born in 1477, and dying in
1576, in his ninety-ninth year, the great Italian artist was contemporary
with a long series of illustrious men, and his fame
and works had shone far beyond their native sky. Our distant
and then but partially civilised England awoke to a perception of
their beauties, and though few—if any—of Titian’s paintings so
early found a domicile in this country, yet pictures were, we are
assured,<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a> “a frequent decoration in the rooms of the wealthy.”
Shakespeare even represents the Countess of Auvergne,
<cite>1 Henry VI.</cite>, act ii. sc. 3, lines 36, 37, vol. v. p. 33, as saying to
Talbot,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>For in my gallery thy picture hangs.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The formation of a royal gallery, or collection of paintings,
had engaged the care of Henry VIII.; and the British nobility
at the time of his daughter Elizabeth’s reign, “deeply read in
classical learning, familiar with the literature of Italy, and
polished by foreign travel,” “were well qualified to appreciate
and cultivate the true principles of taste.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Titian, as is well known, “displayed a singular mastery in
the representation of nude womanly forms, and in this the
witchery of his colouring is manifested with fullest power.”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
Many instances of this are to be found in his works. Two are
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>presented by the renowned Venus-figures at Florence, and by
the beautiful Danae at Naples. The Cambridge gallery contains
the Venus in whose form the Princess Eboli is said to
have been portrayed, playing the lute, and having Philip of
Spain seated at her side. In the Bridgewater gallery are two
representations of Diana in the bath,—the one having the story
of Actæon, and the other discovering the guilt of Calisto; and
in the National Gallery are a Bacchus and Ariadne, and also a
good copy, from the original at Madrid, of Venus striving to
hold back Adonis from the chase. To these we may add the
Arming of Cupid, in the Borghese palace at Rome, in which he
quietly permits Venus to bind his eyes, while another Cupid
whispering leans on her shoulder, and two Graces bring forward
quivers and bows.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to such a School of Painting, or to such a master of
his art, that Shakespeare alludes, when, in the Induction scene
to the <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite>, Christopher Sly is served and
waited on as a lord:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Sec. Serv.</em> Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight</div>
      <div class='line'>Adonis painted by a running brook.</div>
      <div class='line'>And Cytherea all in sedges hid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even as the waving sedges play with wind.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Lord.</em> We’ll show thee Io as she was a maid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And how she was beguiled and surprised,</div>
      <div class='line'>As lively painted as the deed was done.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Third Serv.</em> Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,</div>
      <div class='line'>So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Among Shakespeare’s gifts was also the power to appreciate
the charms of melody and song. Their influence he felt, and
their effect he most eloquently describes. He speaks of them
with a sweetness, a gentleness, and force which must have had
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>counterparts in his own nature. As in the <cite>Midsummer Night’s
Dream</cite>, act ii. sc. 1, line 148, vol. ii. p. 215, when Oberon bids
Puck to come to her,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in15'>“Thou rememberest</div>
      <div class='line'>Since once I sat upon a promontory,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heard a mermaid, on a dolphin’s back,</div>
      <div class='line'>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>That the rude sea grew civil at her song,</div>
      <div class='line'>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres</div>
      <div class='line'>To hear the sea-maid’s music.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And again, in the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, act v. sc. 1, lines
2 and 54, vol. ii. p. 360, how exquisite the description!—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they did make no noise.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Lorenzo’s discourse to Jessica is such as only a passion-warmed
genius could conceive and utter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!</div>
      <div class='line'>Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music</div>
      <div class='line'>Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night</div>
      <div class='line'>Become the touches of sweet harmony.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven</div>
      <div class='line'>Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st</div>
      <div class='line'>But in his motion like an angel sings,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such harmony is in immortal souls.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Ferdinand, in the <cite>Tempest</cite>, act i. sc. 2, l. 387, vol. i, p. 20,
after listening to Ariel’s song, “Come unto these yellow sands,”
thus testifies to its power:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Where should this music be? i’ th’ air, or th’ earth?</div>
      <div class='line'>It sounds no more: and sure it waits upon</div>
      <div class='line'>Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weeping again the king my father’s wreck,</div>
      <div class='line'>This music crept by me upon the waters</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>Allaying both their fury and my passion</div>
      <div class='line'>With its sweet air: thence have I follow’d it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or it hath drawn me rather.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus, from his sufficient command over the requisite languages,
from his diligent reading in the literature of his country,
translated as well as original, from his opportunities of frequent
converse with the cultivated minds of his age, and still more
from what we have shown him to have possessed,—accurate
taste and both an intelligent and a warm appreciation of the
principles and beauties of Imitative Art,—we conclude that
Shakespeare found it a study congenial to his spirit and powers,
to examine and apply, what was both popular and learned in
its day,—the illustrations, by the graver’s art and the poet’s pen,
of the proverbial wisdom which constitutes almost the essence of
the Emblematical writers of the sixteenth century. To him, as
to others, their works would be sources of interest and amusement;
and even in hours of idleness many a sentiment would
be gathered up to be afterwards almost unconsciously assimilated
for the mind’s nurture and growth.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we maintain that Shakespeare not unfrequently made
use of the Emblem writers, we do not mean to imply that he
was generally a direct copyist from them. This is seldom the
case. But a word, a phrase, or an allusion, sufficiently demonstrates
whence particular thoughts have been derived, and how
they have been coloured and clothed. They have been
gathered as flowers in a country-walk are gathered—one from
this hedge-side, another from that, and a third from among the
standing corn, and others from the margin of some murmuring
stream; but all have their natural beauty heightened by the
skill with which they are blended so as to impart gracefulness
to the whole. Flora’s gems they may be, but the enwoven
coronal borrows its chief charm from the artistic power and
fitness with which its parts are arranged: break the thread, or
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>cut the string with which Genius has bound them together, and
they fall into inextricable confusion—a mass of disorder—no
longer a pride and a joy: but let them remain, as a most
excellent skill has placed them, and for ever could we gaze on
their loveliness. A matchless beauty has been achieved, and
all the more do we value it, because upon it there is also stamped
eternal youth.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_0'>
MONUMENTS, or memorial stones, with
emblematical figures and characters
carved upon them, are of ancient date
in Britain as elsewhere—probably antecedent
even to Christianity itself. Manuscripts,
too, ornamented with many a
symbolical device, carry us back several
hundred years. These we may dismiss
from consideration at the present moment, and simply take up
printed books devoted chiefly or entirely to Emblems.</p>

<p class='c000'>I.—Of printed Emblem-books in the earlier time down to
1598, when Willet’s <cite>Century of Sacred Emblems</cite> appeared, though
there were several in the English language, there were only few
of pure English origin. Watson and Barclay, in 1509, gave
English versions of Sebastian Brant’s <cite>Fool-freighted Ship</cite>. Not
later than 1536, nor earlier than 1517, <cite>The Dialogue of Creatures
moralysed</cite> was translated “out of latyn in to our English tonge.”
In 1549, at Lyons, <cite>The Images of the Old Testament, &amp;c.</cite>, were
“set forthe in Ynglishe and Frenche;” and in 1553, from the
same city, Peter Derendel gave in English metre <cite>The true and
lyvely historyke Portreatures of the woll Bible</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Workes of Sir Thomas More Knyght, sometyme Lorde
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>Chauncellour of England</cite>, were published in small folio, London,
1557, and in them at the beginning (signature C ij<em>v</em>—C iiij) are
inserted what the author names “nyne pageauntes,” which, as
they existed in his father’s house about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1496, were certainly
Emblems. To this list Sir Thomas North, in London, 1570,
added <cite>The Morall Philosophie of Doni</cite>, “out of Italien;”
Daniell, in 1585, <cite>The worthy Tract of Paulus Jovius</cite>, which
Whitney, in 1586, followed up by <cite>A Choice of Emblemes</cite>,
“Englished and moralized;” and Paradin’s <cite>Heroicall Devises</cite>
were “Translated out of Latin into English,” London, 1591.</p>

<p class='c000'>To vindicate something of an English origin for a few
emblems at least, reference may again be made to the fact that
about the year 1495 or 6, “Mayster Thomas More in his youth
deuysed in hys fathers house in London, a goodly hangyng of
fyne paynted clothe, with nyne pageauntes,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a> and verses ouer
of euery of those pageauntes: which verses expressed and
declared, what the ymages in those pageauntes represented:
and also in those pageauntes were paynted, the thynges that the
verses ouer them dyd (in effecte) declare.” In 1592, Wyrley
published at London <cite>The true use of Armories, &amp;c.</cite>; soon after
appeared Emblems by Thomas Combe, which, however, are no
longer known to be in existence; and then, in 1598, Andrew
Willet’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Sacrorvm Emblematvm Centvria vna, &amp;c.</cite></span>,—“A Century
of Sacred Emblems.” Guillim, in 1611, supplied <cite>A Display of
Heraldry</cite>; and Peacham, in 1612, <cite>A Garden of Heroical
Devices</cite>. There were, too, in MSS., several Emblem-works in
English, some of which have since been edited and made
known.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet we must not suppose that the knowledge of Emblem-books
in Britain depended on those only of which an English
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>version had been achieved. To men of culture, the whole series
was open in almost its entire extent. James Hamilton, Earl of
Arran, had resided in France, and in 1555, being high in the
favour of Henry II., “was made captain of his Scotch life-guards.”
A few years before, namely, in 1549, as we have
mentioned, p. 108, Aneau’s French translation of Alciat’s
<cite>Emblems</cite> had been dedicated to him as, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“filz de tres noble
Prince Jacque Due de Chastel le herault, Prince Gouverneur du
Royaume d’Escoce.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the rare books in the British Museum is Marquale’s
Italian Version of Alciat’s <cite>Emblems</cite>, printed at Lyons in 1549;
a copy of it, a very lovely book, in the original binding, bears on
the back the royal crown, and at the foot the letters “E. VI. R.,”—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Edwardus
Sextus Rex</em></span>; and, as he died in 1553, we thus have
evidence at how early a date the work was known in England.
To the young king it would doubtless be a book “for delight
and for ornament.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Holbein’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Imagines Mortis</cite></span>, Lyons, 1545, by George
Æmylius, Luther’s brother-in-law, a copy now in the British
Museum “was presented to Prince Edward by Dr. William Bill,
accompanied with a Latin dedication, dated from Cambridge,
19th July, 1546, wherein he recommends the prince’s attention
to the figures in the book, in order to remind him that all must
die to obtain immortality; and enlarges on the necessity of
living well. He concludes with a wish that the Lord will long
and happily preserve his life, and that he may finally reign to
all eternity with his <em>most Christian father</em>. Bill was appointed
one of the king’s chaplains in ordinary, 1551, and was made the
first Dean of Westminster in the reign of Elizabeth.”—Douce’s
<cite>Holbein</cite>, Bohn’s ed., 1858, pp. 93, 94.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1548, Mary of Scotland was sent into France for her education
(Rapin, ed. 1724, vol. vi. p. 30), and here imbibed the taste
for, or rather knowledge of, Emblems, which afterwards she put
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>into practice. To her son, in his fourteenth year, emblems were
introduced by no less an authority than that of Theodore Beza.
A copy indeed of the works of Alciatus was bound for him
when he became King of England,—it is a folio edition, in six
volumes or parts, and is still preserved in the British Museum;
the royal arms are on the cover, front and back, and fleurs-de-lis
in the corners. It was printed at Lyons in 1560, and possibly
the Emblems in vol. vi., leaves 334–354, with their very beautiful
devices, may have been the companions of his boyhood
and early years. By the Emblem-works of Beza and of
Alciat probably was laid the foundation of the king’s love
for allegorical representations, which, under the name of
masques, were provided by Jonson for the Court’s amusement.
The king’s weakness in this respect is wittily set forth in the
French epigram soon after his death (Rapin’s <cite>History</cite>, 4to,
vol. vii. p. 259):—</p>

<p class='c000'>To English noblemen, in 1608, Otho van Veen, from
Antwerp, commends his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Amorum Emblemata</cite></span>,—“Emblems of
the Loves,”—with 124 excellent devices. Thus the dedication
runs: “To the moste honorable and woerthie brothers, <em>William</em>
Earle of <em>Pembroke</em>, and <em>Philip</em> Earle of <em>Mountgomerie</em>, patrons
of learning and cheualrie.” In England, therefore, as in Scotland,
there were eminent lovers of the Emblem literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>But an acquaintance with that literature may be regarded as
more spread abroad and increased when Emblem-books became
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>the sources of ornamentation for articles of household furniture,
and for the embellishment of country mansions. A remarkable
instance is supplied from <cite>The History of Scotland</cite>, edition
London, 1655, “By William Drummond of Hauthornden.” It
is in a letter “<em>To his worthy Friend</em> Master Benjamin Johnson,”
dated July 1, 1619, respecting some needle-work by Mary
Queen of Scots, and shows how intimately she was acquainted
with several of the Emblem-books of her day, or had herself
attained the art of making devices. The whole letter, except a
few lines at the beginning, is most interesting to the admirers of
Emblems. Drummond thus writes:—</p>

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Materiam superabat opus</em></span>.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>It would be tedious to verify, as might be done in nearly
every instance, the original authors of these twenty-nine <em>Impreses</em>
and Emblems. Several of them are in our own Whitney,
several in Paradin’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Devises heroiques</cite></span>, and several in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Dialogve
des Devises d’armes et d’amovrs dv S. Pavlo Jovio, &amp;c.</cite></span>, 4to, A
Lyon, 1561.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the last named author we select as specimens two of
the Emblems with which Queen Mary embellished the bed for
her son;—the first is “the <em>Impressa</em> of King <em>Francis</em> the First,”
who, as the <em>Dialogue</em>, p. 24, affirms, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>changea la fierté des
deuises de guerre en la douceur &amp; ioyeuseté amoureuse</em>,”</span>—“And
to signify that he was glowing with the passions of love,—and
so pleasing were they to him, that he had the boldness to
say that he found nourishment in them;—for this reason he
chose the Salamander, which dwelling in the flames is not consumed.”
(See woodcut next page.) The second, p. 25, is “the
<em>Impressa</em> of <em>Henry</em> the second, the <em>French King</em>,” the son and
successor of Francis in 1547. (See woodcut, p. 127.)</p>

<p class='c000'>He had adopted the motto and device when he was Dauphin,
and continued to bear them on his succession to the throne;—in
the one case to signify that he could not show his entire
worth until he arrived at the heritage of the kingdom; and in
the other that he must recover for his kingdom what had been
lost to it, and so complete its whole orb.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may appear almost impossible, even on a “Bed of State,”
to work twenty-nine Emblems and the arms of Scotland,
England, and France, “severally by themselves and all quartered
in many places of the bed,”—but a bed, probably of equal
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>antiquity, was a few years since, if not now, existing at Hinckley
in Leicestershire, on which the same number “of emblematical
devices, and Latin mottoes in capital letters conspicuously
introduced,” had found space and to spare. All these emblems
are, I believe, taken from books of Shakespeare’s time, or before
him; as, “An ostrich with a horseshoe in the beak,” the word,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Spiritus durissima coquit</em></span>; “a cross-bow at full stretch,” the
word, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Ingenio superat vires</em></span>. “A hand playing with a serpent,”
the word, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Quis contra nos?</em></span> “The tree of life springing from the
cross on an altar,”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a> the word, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Sola vivit in illo</em></span>. (See <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite>, vol. lxxxi. pt. 2, p. 416, Nov. 1811.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the use of Emblematical devices in the ornamenting of
houses, it will be sufficient to give the instance recorded in
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>“The History and Antiquities of Hawsted and Hardwick, in the
county of Suffolk, by the Rev. Sir John Cullum, Bart:” the 2nd
edition, royal 4to, London, 1813, pp. 159–165. This History
makes it evident that in the reign of James I., if not earlier,
Emblems were so known and admired as to have been freely
employed in adorning a closet for the last Lady Drury. “They
mark the taste of an age that delighted in quaint wit, and
laboured conceits of a thousand kinds,” says Sir John; nevertheless,
there were <em>forty-one</em> of them in “the painted closet” at
Hawsted, and which, at the time of his writing, were put up in a
small apartment at Hardwick. To all of them, as for King
James’s bed, and for the “very antient oak wooden bedstead,
much gilt and ornamented,” at Hinckley, there were a Latin
motto and a device. Some of them we now present to the
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>reader, adding occasionally to our author’s account a further
notice of the sources whence they were taken:</p>

<p class='c000'>Emblem 1. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Ut parta labuntur</em></span>,—“As procured they are
slipping away.” “A monkey, sitting in a window and scattering
money into the streets, is among the emblems of Gabriel Simeon:”
it is also in our own English Whitney, p. 169, with the word,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Malè parta malè delabuntur</em></span>,—“Badly gotten, badly scattered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Emblem 5. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Quò tendis?</em></span>—“Whither art thou going?” “A
human tongue with bats’ wings, and a scaly contorted tail,
mounting into the air,” “is among the <cite>Heroical Devises of Paradin</cite>:”
leaf 65 of edition Anvers, 1562.</p>

<p class='c000'>Emblem 8. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Jam satis</em></span>,—“Already enough.” “Some trees,
leafless, and torn up by the roots; with a confused landscape.
Above, the sun, and a rainbow;” a note adds, “the most faire
and bountiful queen of France Katherine used the sign of the
rainbow for her armes, which is an infallible sign of peaceable
calmeness and tranquillitie.”—Paradin. Paradin’s words, ed.
1562, leaf 38, are <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>Madame Catherine, treschretienne Reine de
France, a pour Deuise l’Arc celeste, ou Arc en ciel: qui est le vrai
signe de clere serenité &amp; tranquilité de Paix</em>.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'>Emblem 20. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Dum transis</em></span>, <em>time</em>,—“While thou art crossing,
fear.” “A pilgrim traversing the earth: with a staff, and a light
coloured hat, with a cockle shell in it.” In <cite>Hamlet</cite>, act iv. sc. 5,
l. 23, vol. viii. p. 129,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How should I your true love know</div>
      <div class='line in3'>From another one?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>By his cockle hat and staff,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And his sandal shoon.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Or,” remarks Sir John Cullum, “as he is described in Greene’s

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>Emblem 24. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Fronte nulla fides</em></span>,—“No trustworthiness on the
brow.” The motto with a different device occurs in Whitney’s
<cite>Emblems</cite>, p. 100, and was adopted by him from the Emblems
of John Sambucus; edition Antwerp, 1564, p. 177. The device,
however, in “the painted closet” was “a man taking the dimensions
of his own forehead with a pair of compasses;” “a contradiction,”
inaptly remarks Sir J. Cullum, “to a fancy of Aristotle’s
that the shape and several other circumstances, relative to a
man’s forehead, are expressive of his temper and inclination.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon this supposition Symeon,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c015'><sup>[79]</sup></a> before mentioned, has invented
an Emblem, representing a human head and a hand issuing out
of a cloud, and pointing to it, with this motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Frons hominem
præfert</em></span>,—“The forehead shows the man.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>Emblem 33. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Speravi et perii</em></span>,—“I hoped and perished;”—the
device, “A bird thrusting its head into an oyster partly open.”
A very similar sentiment is rather differently expressed by
Whitney, p. 128, by Freitag, p. 169, and by Alciat, edition
Paris, 1602, emb. 94, p. 437, from whom it was borrowed.
Here the device is a mouse invading the domicile of an oyster,
the motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Captivus ob gulam</em></span>,—“A prisoner through gluttony;”
and the poor little mouse—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line in13'>“That longe did feede on daintie crommes,</div>

<p class='c000'>Now, since so many Emblems from various authors were
gathered to adorn a royal bed,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a> “a very antient oak wooden
bed,” and “a lady’s closet,” in widely distant parts of Britain,
the supposition is most reasonable that the knowledge of them
pervaded the cultivated and literary society of England and
Scotland; and that Shakespeare, as a member of such society,
would also be acquainted with them. The facts themselves are
testimonies of a generally diffused judgment and taste, by which
Emblematic devices for ornaments would be understood and
appreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the facts we have mentioned are not solitary. About
the period in question, in various mansions of the two kingdoms,
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>Device and Emblem were employed for their adorning. In
1619, close upon Shakespeare’s time, and most likely influenced
by his writings, there was set up in the Ancient Hall of the
Leycesters of Lower Tabley, Cheshire, a richly carved and very
curious chimney-piece, which may be briefly described as emblematizing
country pursuits in connection with those of heraldry,
literature, and the drama. In high relief, on one of the upright
slabs, is a Lucrece, as the poet represents the deed, line 1723,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast</div>
      <div class='line'>A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>On the other slab is a Cleopatra, with the deadly creature in
her hand, though not at the very moment when she addressed
the asp;—act. v. sc. 2, l. 305, vol. ix. p. 151,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“Peace, peace!</div>
      <div class='line'>Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>That sucks the nurse asleep?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The cross slab represents the hunting of stag and hare, which
with the hounds have wonderfully human faces. Here might
the words of Titus Andronicus, act. ii. sc. 2, l. 1, vol. vii. p. 456,
be applied,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c000'>The heraldic insignia of the Leycesters surmount the whole,
but just below them, in a large medallion, is an undeniable
Emblem, similar to one which in 1624 appeared in Hermann
Hugo’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pia Desideria</cite></span>, bk. i. emb. xv. p. 117; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Defecit in dolore

sighing.” Appended to Hugo’s device are seventy-six lines of
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>Latin elegiac verses, and five pages of illustrative quotations
from the Fathers; but the character of the Emblem will be seen
from the device presented.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drayton in his <cite>Barons’ Wars</cite>, bk. vi., published in 1598,
shows how the knowledge of our subject had spread and was

<p class='c000'>There is, however, no occasion to pursue any further this
branch of our theme, except it may be by a short continuation
or extension of our Period of time, to show how Milton’s greater
Epic most curiously corresponds with the title-page of a Dutch

      <div class='line'>His acts being seven ages.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The same notion is repeated in the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, act. i.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In England, as elsewhere, emblematical carvings and writings
preceded books of Emblems, that is, books in which the art of</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>the engraver and the genius of the poet were both employed to
illustrate one and the same motto, sentiment, or proverbial
saying. Not to repeat what may be found in Chaucer and
others, Spenser’s <cite>Visions of Bellay</cite>,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a> alluded to in the fac-simile
reprint of Whitney, pp. xvi &amp; xvii, needed only the designer and
engraver to make them as perfectly Emblem-books as were the
publications of Brant, Alciatus and Perriere. Those visions
portray in words what an artist might express by a picture.
For example, in Moxon’s edition, 1845, p. 438, iv.,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I saw raisde vp on pillers of Iuorie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wereof the bases were of richest golde,</div>
      <div class='line'>The chapters Alabaster, Christall frises,</div>
      <div class='line'>The double front of a triumphall arke.</div>
      <div class='line'>On eche side portraide was a Victorie,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now what artist’s skill would not suffice from this description
to delineate “the pillers of Iuorie,” “the chapters of Alabaster,”
“a Victorie with golden wings,” and “the triumphing chaire, the
auncient glorie of the Romane lordes;” and to make the whole
a lively and most cunning Emblem?</p>

<p class='c000'>In his <cite>Shepheards Calender</cite>, indeed, to each of the months
Spenser appends what he names an “Emblem;” it is a motto,
or device, from Greek, Latin, Italian, French, or English, expressive
of the supposed leading idea of each Eclogue, and forming
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>a moral to it. The folio edition of Spenser’s works, issued in
1616, gives woodcuts for each month, and so approaches very
closely to the Emblematists of a former century. In the month
“<span class='fss'>FEBRVARIE</span>,” there is introduced a veritable word-picture of
“the Oake and the Brier,” and also a pictorial illustration, with
the sign of the Fishes in the clouds, to indicate the season of
the year.  The oak is described as “broughten to miserie:”
l. 213,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For nought mought they quitten him from decay,</div>

      <div class='line'>And sighed to see his neere overthrow.</div>
      <div class='line'>In fine, the steele had pierced his pith,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tho downe to the earth hee fell forthwith.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Brier, “puffed up with pryde,” has his turn of adversity:

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>The whole Eclogue, or Fable, is rounded off by the curious
Italian proverbs, to which Spenser gives the name of Emblems,—</p>

<p class='c000'>The Emblem for June represents a scene which the poet does
not describe; it is the field of the haymakers, with the zodiacal
sign of the Crab, and appropriate to the characters of Hobbinoll
and Colin Clout,— but it certainly does not translate into
pictures what the poet had delineated in words of great beauty:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>“Lo! Colin, here the place whose plesaunt syte</div>

      <div class='line'>To the waters fall their tunes attemper right.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>No more needs be said respecting the knowledge of Emblem-books
in Britain, unless it be to give the remarks of Tod, the
learned editor of Spenser’s works, edition 1845, p. x. “<cite>The
Visions</cite> are little things, done probably when Spenser was
<em>young</em>, according to the taste of the times for Emblems.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a> The
<cite>Theatre of Wordlings</cite>, I must add, evidently presents a series
of Emblems.”</p>

<p class='c007'>II. We will now state some of the general indications that
Shakespeare was acquainted with Emblem-books, or at least had
imbibed “the taste of the times.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here and there in Shakespeare’s works, even from the way
in which sayings and mottoes, in Spanish, as well as in French
and Latin, are employed, we have indications that he had seen
and, it may be, had studied some of the Emblem-writers of his
day, and participated of their spirit. Thus Falstaff’s friend, the
ancient Pistol, <cite>2 Henry IV.</cite> act. ii. sc. 4, l. 165, vol. iv. p. 405,
quotes the doggerel line, as given in the note, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>Si fortuna me
tormenta, il sperare me contenta</em></span>,—“If fortune torments me, hope
contents me,”—which doubtless was the motto on his sword,
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>which he immediately lays down.  As quoted, the line is
Spanish; a slight alteration would make it Italian; but
Douce’s conjecture appears well founded, that as Pistol was
preparing to lay aside his sword, he read
off the motto which was upon it. Such
mottoes were common as inscriptions upon
swords; and Douce, vol. i. pp. 452, 3, gives
the drawing of one with the French line,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Si fortune me tourmente, L’esperance me
contente.”</span></p>

<div  class='figleft id030'>
<img src='images/img057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Douce, 1807.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He gives it, too, as a fact, that “Haniball
Gonsaga being in the low-countries
overthrowne from his horse by an English
captaine and commanded to yeeld himselfe
prisoner, <em>kist his sword</em>, and gave it to
the Englishman, saying, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘<em>Si fortuna me
tormenta, il speranza me contenta</em>.’</span>” Allow
that Shakespeare served in the Netherlands,
and we may readily suppose that
he had heard the motto from the very
Englishman to whom Gonsaga had surrendered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Clown in <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>, act. i.
sc. 5, l. 50, vol. iii. p. 234, replies to the
Lady Olivia ordering him as a fool to be
taken away,—“Misprision in the highest
degree! Lady, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>cucullus non facit monachum</em></span>,
[—it is not the hood that makes the monk,]—that’s
as much to say as I wear not
motley in my brain.” The saying is one
which might appropriately adorn any Emblem-book of the
day;—and the motley-wear receives a good illustration from a
corresponding expression in Whitney, p. 81:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>“The little childe, is pleas’de with cockhorse gaie,</div>

      <div class='line'>And is disgrac’de when he is brauelie dreste:</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Hee better likes, than Jewelles that excell.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>So, during Cade’s rebellion, when the phrase is applied by
Lord Say, in answer to Dick the butcher’s question, “What say
you of Kent?” <cite>2 Henry VI.</cite> act. iv. sc. 7, l. 49, vol. v. p. 197,—</p>

      <div class='line'>“Nothing but this: ’Tis <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>bona terra, mala gens</em></span>;”</div>

<p class='c000'>or when falling under the attack of York on the field of
St. Alban’s, Lord Clifford exclaims, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>La fin couronne les œuvres</em></span>
(<cite>2 Henry VI.</cite> act. v. sc. 2, l. 28, vol. v. p. 217); these again are
instances after the methods of Emblem-writers; and if they
were carried out, as might be done, would present all the
characteristics of the Emblem, in motto, illustrative woodcut,
and descriptive verses.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is but an allusion, and yet the opening scene, act. i. sc. 1,
l. 50, vol. ii. p. 280, of the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> might borrow that

<p class='c000'>Even if Shakespeare understood no Latin, the picture itself,
or a similar one, would be sufficient to give origin to the phrase
“two-headed Janus.”
He adopts the picture,
but not one of
the sentiments; these,
however, he did not
need: it was only as
a passing illustration
that he named Janus,
and how the author
described the god’s
qualities was no part
of his purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Or if the source of
the phrase be not in
Alciatus, it may have been derived either from Whitney’s <cite>Choice

Paris, 1539, emb. i., reproduced in 1866 to illustrate pl. 30 of the

<p class='c000'>Another instance of Emblem-like delineation, or description,
we have in <cite>King Henry V.</cite> act iii. sc. 7, lines 10–17, vol. iv.
p. 549. Louis the Dauphin, praising his own horse, as if
bounding from the earth like a tennis ball (see woodcut on next
page), exclaims,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four
pasterns. Ça, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his entrails were
hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus, chez les narines de feu! When I
bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth sings
when he touches it; the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the
pipe of Hermes.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c026'><em>Orl.</em> He’s of the colour of the nutmeg.</p>

<p class='c026'><em>Dau.</em> And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus: he is
pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in
him, but only in patient stillness, while his rider mounts him: he is indeed a
horse; and all other jades you may call beasts.</p>

<p class='c026'><em>Con.</em> Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.</p>

<p class='c026'><em>Dau.</em> It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the bidding of a
monarch, and his countenance enforces homage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c015'><sup>[88]</sup></a> we have a Pegasus like that which Shakespeare
praises; it has a warrior on its back, and bounds along, trotting
the air. In other two of Reusner’s <cite>Emblems</cite>, the Winged
Horse is standing on the ground, with Perseus near him; and
in a third, entitled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Principis boni imago</cite></span>,—“Portrait of a good

the Dragon, and delivering from its fury the Maiden chained to

Shakespeare probably had seen these or similar drawings before
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>he described Louis the Dauphin riding on a charger that had
nostrils of fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The qualities of good horsemanship Shakespeare specially
admired. Hence those lines in <cite>Hamlet</cite>, act iv. sc. 7, l. 84,
vol. viii. p. 145,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’ve seen myself, and served against, the French,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they can well on horseback: but this gallant</div>
      <div class='line'>Had witchcraft in’t; he grew unto his seat,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</div>
      <div class='line'>As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</div>
      <div class='line'>With the brave beast.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>An emblem in Alciatus, edition 1551, p. 20, also gives the
mounted warrior on the winged horse;—it is Bellerophon in his
contest with the Chimæra. The accompanying stanza has in it
an expression like one which the dramatist uses,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sic tu Pegaseis vectus petis æthera pennis,”—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So thou being borne on the wings of Pegasus seekest the air.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Equally tasting of the Emblem-writers of Henry’s and
Elizabeth’s reigns is that other proverb in French which Shakespeare
places in the mouth of the Dauphin Louis. The subject
is still his “paragon of animals,” which he prefers even to his
mistress. See <cite>Henry V.</cite> act iii. sc. 7, l. 54, vol iv. p. 550. “I
had rather,” he says, “have my horse to my mistress;” and the
Constable replies, “I had as lief have my mistress a jade.”</p>

<p class='c027'>“<em>Dau.</em> I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.</p>

<p class='c026'><em>Con.</em> I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow to my
mistress.</p>

<p class='c026'><em>Dau.</em> Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement, et la truie
lavée au bourbier. Thou makest use of anything.” [“The dog has returned
to his vomit, and the sow that had been washed, to her mire.”]</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the French is almost a literal rendering of the Latin
Vulgate, <cite>2 Pet.</cite> ii. 23, “Canis reversus ad suum vomitum: &amp; sus
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>lota in volutabro luti;” the whole conception is in the spirit of
Freitag’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mythologia Ethica</cite></span>, Antwerp, 1579, in which there is appended
to each emblem a text of Scripture. A subject is chosen, a
description of it given, an engraving placed on the opposite page,
and at the foot some passage from the Latin vulgate is applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may indeed be objected that, if Shakespeare was well
acquainted with the Emblem literature it is surprising he should
pass over, almost in silence, some Devices which partake
peculiarly of his general spirit, and which would furnish suggestions
for very forcible and very appropriate descriptions. Were
we to examine his works thoroughly, we should discover some
very remarkable omissions of subjects that appear to be exactly
after his own method and perfectly natural to certain parts of
his dramas. We may instance the almost total want of commendation
for the moral qualities of the dog, whether “mastiff,
greyhound, mongrel grim, hound or spaniel, brach or lym, or
bob-tail tike, or trundle-tail.” The whole race is under a ban.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Otiosi semper egentes</em></span>,—“The idle always
destitute,”—Whitney, p. 175, describes the same conditions,—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The idea is in some degree approached in the Chorus of
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Henry V.</em></span> act i. l. 5, vol. iv. p. 491,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>Crouch for employment.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The triumph of industry may also be inferred from the
marriage blessing which Ceres pronounces in the Masque of the
<cite>Tempest</cite>, act iv. sc. 1, l. 110, vol. i. p. 57,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Yet for labour, work, industry, diligence, or by whatever
other name the virtue of steady exertion may be known, there
is scarcely a word of praise in Shakespeare’s abundant vocabulary,
and of its effects no clear description. We are told in
<cite>Cymbeline</cite>, act iii. sc. 6, l. 31, vol. ix. p. 240,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Finds the down pillow hard.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And in contrasting the cares of royalty with the sound sleep of
the slave, Henry V. (act iv. sc. 1, l. 256, vol iv. p. 564) declares
that the slave,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Never sees horrid night, the child of hell;</div>
      <div class='line'>But like a lacquey, from the rise to set,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweats in the eye of Phœbus, and all night</div>
      <div class='line'>Sleeps in Elysium; next day, after dawn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doth rise, and help Hyperion to his horse;</div>
      <div class='line'>And follow so the ever running year</div>
      <div class='line'>With profitable labour to his grave;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>but the subject is never entered upon in its moral and social
aspects, unless the evils which are ascribed by the Duke of
Burgundy (<cite>Henry V.</cite> act v. sc. 2, l. 48, vol. iv. p. 596) to war, are
also to be attributed to the negligence which war creates,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth</div>

      <div class='line'>Losing both beauty and utility.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>Another instance we may give of that Emblem spirit, which
often occurs in Shakespeare, and at the same time we may
supply an example of Freitag’s method of illustrating a subject,
and of appending to it a scriptural quotation. (See <cite>Mythologia
Ethica</cite>, Antwerp, 1579, p. 29.) The instance is from <cite>King Lear</cite>,
act ii. sc. 4, l. 61, vol. viii. p. 317, and the subject, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Contraria
industriæ ac desidiæ præmia</em></span>—“The opposite rewards of industry
and slothfulness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Lear had arrived at the Earl of Gloster’s castle, Kent
inquires,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“How chance the king comes with so small a train?</p>

<p class='c026'><em>Fool.</em> An thou hadst been set i’ the stocks for that question, thou hadst well deserv’d it.</p>

<p class='c026'><em>Gent.</em> Why, fool?</p>

<p class='c026'><em>Fool.</em> We’ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there’s no labouring
in the winter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That school we have presented to us in Freitag’s engraving
(see woodcut on next page), and in the stanzas of Whitney,
p. 159. There are the ne’er-do-well grasshopper and the sage
schoolmaster of an ant, propounding, we may suppose, the
wise saying, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Dum ætatis ver agitur: consule brumæ</em></span>,—“While
the spring of life is passing, consult for winter,”—and the poet
moralizes thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>In</span> winter coulde, when tree, and bushe, was bare,</div>

<p class='c000'>Freitag’s representation makes indeed a change in the season
at which the “ante, with longe experience wise,” administers
her reproof; but it is equally the school for learning in the time
of youth and strength, to provide for the infirmities of age and
the adversities of fortune.</p>

<p class='c007'>And more than similar in spirit to the Emblem writers which
preceded, almost emblems themselves, are the whole scenes
from the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, act ii. sc. 7 and 9, and act iii. sc. 2,
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>where are introduced the three caskets of gold, of silver, and
of lead, by the choice of which the fate of Portia is to be
determined,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c015'><sup>[90]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>“The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;’</div>
      <div class='line'>The second, silver, which this promise carries,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;’</div>
      <div class='line'>This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,</div>

      <div class='c017'>Act ii. sc. 7, lines 4–9.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And when the caskets are opened, the drawings and the
inscriptions on the written scrolls, which are then taken out,
examined and read, are exactly like the engravings and the
verses by which emblems and their mottoes are set forth.
Thus, on unlocking the golden casket, the Prince of Morocco
exclaims,—</p>

      <div class='c017'>Act ii. sc. 7, lines 62–73.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Prince of Arragon, also, on opening the silver casket,
receives not merely a written scroll, as is represented in

<p class='c000'>This device, in fact, was
one extremely popular with
the Emblem literati. Boissard
and Messin’s <cite>Emblems</cite>,
1588, pp. 58, 59, present it
to the mottoes, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Temerité
dangereuse,”</span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Temere ac
Pericvlose</cite></span>,—“rashly and dangerously.”
Joachim Camerarius,
in his Emblems <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ex Volatilibus
et Insectis</cite></span> (Nuremberg,
4to, 1596), uses it, with the
motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Brevis et damnosa
Voluptas</em></span>—“A short and destructive
pleasure,”—and fortifies
himself in adopting
it by no less authorities
than Æschylus and Aristotle.
<cite>Emblemes of Love, with
Verses in Latin, English, and Italian</cite>, by Otho Vænius,
4to, Antwerp, 1608, present Cupid to us, at p. 102, as watching
the moths and the flames with great earnestness, the
mottoes being, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Brevis et damnosa voluptas</em></span>,—“For one pleasure
a thousand paynes,”—and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Breue gioia</em></span>,—“Brief the
gladness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is, too, on the same subject, the elegant device which
Symeoni gives at p. 25 of his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Distichi Morali</span>,”</span> and which
we repeat on the next page.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject is, <em>Of Love too much</em>; and the motto, “Too much

beauty of the language as well as in the excellence of the device,

<p class='c000'>In these scenes of the casket, Shakespeare himself, therefore,
is undoubtedly an Emblem writer; and there needs only the
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>woodcut, or the engraving, to render them as perfect examples
of Emblem writing as any that issued from the pens of Alciatus,
Symeoni, and Beza. The dramatist may have been sparing in
his use of this tempting method of illustration, yet, with the
instances before us, we arrive at the conclusion that Shakespeare
knew well what Emblems were. And surely he had seen, and in
some degree studied, various portions of the Emblem literature
which was anterior to, or contemporary with himself.</p>

SHAKESPEARE’S name, in three quarto
editions, published during his lifetime,
appears as author of the play of <cite>Pericles,
Prince of Tyre</cite>; and if a decision be made
that the authorship belongs to him, and
that in the main the work was his composition,
then our previous conjectures are changed into certainties,
and we can confidently declare who were the Emblem
writers he refers to, and can exhibit the very passages from
their books which he has copied and adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early folio editions of the plays, those of 1623 and 1632,
omit the <cite>Pericles</cite> altogether, but later editions restore it to a
place among the works of Shakespeare. Dr. Farmer contends
that the hand of the great dramatist is visible only in the last act;
but others controvert this opinion, and maintain, though he was
not the fabricator of the plot, nor the author of every dialogue
and chorus, that his genius is evident in several passages.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Knight’s <cite>Pictorial Shakspere</cite>, supplemental volume, p. 13,
we are informed: “The first edition of <cite>Pericles</cite> appeared in 1609,”—several
years before the dramatist’s death,—“under the following
title,—‘The late and much admired play, called <cite>Pericles, Prince
of Tyre, &amp;c.</cite> By William Shakespeare: London, Glosson, 1609.’”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>According to the Cambridge editors, vol. ix. p. i, Preface,
“another edition was issued in the same year.” The publication
was repeated in 1611, 1619, 1630 and 1635, so that at the very
time when Shakespeare was living, his authorship was set forth;
and after his death, while his friends and contemporaries were
alive, the opinion still prevailed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conclusion at which Knight arrives, sup. vol. pp. 118, 119,
is thus stated by him: “We advocate the belief that <cite>Pyrocles</cite>,
or <cite>Pericles</cite> was a very early work of Shakspere in some form,
however different from that which we possess.” And again,
“We think that the <cite>Pericles</cite> of the beginning of the seventeenth
century was the revival of a play written by Shakspere some
twenty years earlier.... Let us accept Dryden’s opinion, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Shakespeare’s own Muse his Pericles first bore.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Cambridge editors, vol. ix. p. 10, ed. 1866, gave a firmer
judgment:—“There can be no doubt that the hand of Shakespeare
is traceable in many of the scenes, and that throughout
the play he largely retouched, and even rewrote, the work of
some inferior dramatist. But the text has come down to us in
so maimed and imperfect a state that we can no more judge of
what the play was when it left the master’s hand than we should
have been able to judge of <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, if we had only had
the first quarto as authority for the text.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Our own Hallam tells us,—“<cite>Pericles</cite> is generally reckoned to
be in part, and only in part, the work of Shakespeare:” but
with great confidence the critic Schlegel declares,—“This piece
was acknowledged to be a work, but a youthful work of Shakespeare’s.
It is most undoubtedly his, and it has been admitted
into several later editions of his works. The supposed imperfections
originate in the circumstance that Shakespeare here
handled a childish and extravagant romance of the old poet
Gower, and was unwilling to drag the subject out of its proper
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>sphere. Hence he even introduces Gower himself, and makes
him deliver a prologue in his own antiquated language and
versification. This power of assuming so foreign a manner is at
least no proof of helplessness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There are, then, strong probabilities that in the main the
<cite>Pericles</cite> was Shakespeare’s own composition, or at least was
adopted by him; it belongs to his early dramatic life, and at
any rate it may be taken as evidence to show that the Emblem
writers were known and made use of between 1589 and 1609 by
the dramatists of England.</p>

<p class='c000'>Books of Emblems are not indeed mentioned by their titles,
nor so quoted in the <cite>Pericles</cite> as we are accustomed to do, by
making direct references; they were a kind of common property,
on which everyone might pasture his Pegasus or his Mule without
any obligation to tell where his charger had been grazing.
The allusions, however, are so plain, the words so exactly alike,
that they cannot be misunderstood. The author was of a
certainty acquainted with more than one Emblem writer, in
more than one language, and Paradin, Symeoni, and our own
Whitney may be recognised in his pages. We conclude that
he had them before him, and copied from them when he penned
the second scene of the Second Act of <cite>Pericles</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dialogue is between Simonides, king of Pentapolis, and
his daughter, Thaisa, on occasion of the “triumph,” or festive
pageantry, which was held in honour of her birthday. (<cite>Pericles</cite>,
act. ii. sc. 2, lines 17–47, vol. ix. pp. 343, 344.)</p>

<p class='c000'>As with the ornaments “in silk and gold,” which Mary
Queen of Scotland worked on the bed of her son James, or with
those in “the lady’s closet” at Hawsted, we trace them up to
their originals, and pronounce them, however modified, to be
derived from the Emblem-books of their age; so, with respect
to the devices which the six knights bore on their shields, we
conclude that these have their sources in books of the same
character, or in the genius of the author who knew so well how
to contrive and how to execute. Emblems beyond a doubt they
are, though not engraved on our author’s page, as they were on
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>the escutcheons of the knightly company. Take the device
and motto of the gnats or butterflies and the candle; we trace
them from Vænius, Camerarius, and Whitney, to Paradin, from
Paradin to Symeoni, and from Symeoni to Giles Corrozet,—at
every step we pronounce them Emblems,—and should pass the
same judgment, though we could not trace them at all. It is
the same with these devices in the Triumph Scene of <cite>Pericles</cite>;
we discover the origin of some of them in Emblem works of, or
before Shakespeare’s era,—and where we fail to discover, there
we attribute invention, invention guided and perfected by
masters in the art of fashioning pictures to portray thoughts by
means of things. We will, however, in due order consider the
devices and mottoes of these six knights who came to honour
the king’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first knight is the Knight of Sparta,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And the device he bears upon his shield</div>
      <div class='line'>Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun;</div>
      <div class='line'>The word, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Lux tua vita mihi</em></span>.”</div>
      <div class='c017'>Act ii. sc. 2, lines 19–21.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A motto almost identical belongs to an old family of Worcestershire,
the Blounts, of Soddington, of which Sir Edward Blount,
Bart., is, or was the representative; their motto is, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Lux tua vita
mea</em></span>,—“Thy light, my life;”—but their crest is an armed foot
in the sun, not a black Ethiop reaching towards him. There
was a Sir Walter Blount slain on the king’s side at the battle
of Shrewsbury, and whom, previous to the battle, Shakespeare
represents as sent by Henry IV. with offers of pardon to Percy.
(<cite>Henry IV.</cite> Pt. 1. act. iv. sc. 3, l. 30, vol. iv. p. 323.) A Sir James
Blount is also briefly introduced in <cite>Richard III.</cite> act. v. sc. 2,
l. 615. The name being familiar to Shakespeare, the motto also
might be;—and by a very slight alteration he has ascribed it to
the Knight of Sparta.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>I have consulted a considerable number of books of Emblems
published before the <cite>Pericles</cite> was written, but have not discovered
either the device or “the word” exactly in the form
given in the play. There is a near approach to the device in
Reusner’s <cite>Emblems</cite>, printed at Francfort in 1581 (Emb. 7, lib. i.
p. 9). A man is represented stretching forth his hand towards
the meridian sun, and the device is surmounted by the motto,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Sol animi virtus</em></span>,—“Virtue the sun of the soul.” The elegiac
verses which follow carry out the thought with considerable

<p class='c000'>The introduction of an Ethiop was not unusual with Shakespeare.
In the <cite>Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite> (act. ii. sc. 6. l. 25,

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>“And Silvia,—witness Heaven that made her fair!—</div>
      <div class='line'>Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope;”</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and in <cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite> (act. iv. sc. 3, l. 111, vol. ii. p. 144),
Dumain reads these verses,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Do not call it sin in me,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I am forsworn for thee;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou for whom Jove would swear</div>
      <div class='line'>Juno but an Ethiope were.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A genius so versatile as that of Shakespeare, and capable of
creating almost a whole world of imagination out of a single
hint, might very easily accommodate to his own idea Reusner’s
suggestive motto, and make it yield the light of love to the lover
rather than to the reverend sage. Failing in identifying the
exact source of the “black Ethiope reaching at the sun,” we
may then not unreasonably suppose that Shakespeare himself
formed the device, and fitted the Latin to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Emblem-books of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, the Latin mottoes very greatly preponderated over
those of other languages; and had Shakespeare confined himself
to Latin, it might remain doubtful whether he knew anything
of Emblem works beyond those of our own countrymen—Barclay
and Whitney—and of the two or three translations into
English from Latin, French, and Italian. But the quotation of
a purely Spanish motto, that on the second knight’s device,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>Piu por dulzura que por fuerza</em></span>,—“More by gentleness than by
force” (act ii. sc. 2, l. 27),—shows that his reading and observation
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>extended beyond mere English sources, and that with
other literary men of his day he had looked into, if he had not
studied, the widely-known and very popular writings of Alciatus
and Sambucus among Latinists, of Francisco Guzman and
Hernando Soto among Spaniards, of Gabriel Faerni and Paolo
Giovio among Italians, and of Bartholomew Aneau and Claude
Paradin among the French.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare gives several snatches of French, as in <cite>Twelfth

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Pet.</em> <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘Con tutto il core ben trovato,’</span> may I say.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>We find only two Spanish sentences, those already quoted,—one
being Pistol’s motto on his sword, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>Si fortuna me tormenta
sperato me contenta</em></span>; the other, that of the Prince of Macedon, on
his shield, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>Piu por dulzura que por fuerza</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Similar proverbs and sayings abound both in Cervantes, who
died in 1616, the year of Shakespeare’s death, and in the
Spanish Emblem-books of an earlier date. I have very carefully
examined the Emblems of Alciatus, translated into Spanish in
1549, but the nearest approach to the motto of the Prince of
Macedon is, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>Que mas puede la eloquençia que la fortaliza</em></span> (p. 124),—“Eloquence
rather than force prevails,”—which may be taken
from Alciat’s 180th Emblem, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Eloquentia fortitudine præstantior</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other Spanish Emblem-books of that day are the <cite>Moral
Emblems</cite> of Hernando de Soto, published at Madrid in 1599,
and <cite>Emblems Moralized</cite>, of Don Sebastian Orozco, published in
the year 1610, also at Madrid; but neither of these gives the
words of the second knight’s device. Nor are they contained
in the <cite>Moral Triumphs</cite>, as they are entitled, of Francisco
Guzman, published in 1587, the year after Whitney’s work
appeared. The <cite>Moral Emblems</cite>, too, of Juan de Horozco, are
without them,—an octavo, published at Segovia in 1589.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, although there has been no discovery of this Spanish
motto in a Spanish Emblem-book, the exact literal expression
of it is found in a French work of extreme rarity—Corrozet’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Hecatomgraphie</span>,”</span> Paris, 1540. There, at Emblem 28,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Plus par doulceur que par force</em></span>,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a>—“More by gentleness than
by force,”—is the saying which introduces the old fable
of the Sun and the Wind, and of their contest with the
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>travellers. Appended are a symbolical woodcut and a French
stanza,</p>

<p class='c000'>The same fable is given in Freitag’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Mythologia Ethica</span>,”</span>
Antwerp, 1579, p. 27. It is to a very similar motto,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Moderate force more powerful than impotent violence,”—to
which are added, below the woodcut, two quotations from the
Holy Scriptures,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='c011'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Non quia dominamur fidei.</em></span>”—2 Cor. i. 24.</div>

      <div class='c011'>“Not that we have dominion over your faith;”</div>
      <div class='line'>“To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>implying that not by the rigid exercise of authority, but by a
sympathising spirit, the true faith will be carried onward unto
victory.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, as the motto of the second knight existed in French,
and, as we have seen, Emblem-books were translated into
Spanish, the supposition is justifiable, though we have failed to
trace out the very fact, that the author of the <cite>Pericles</cite>—Shakespeare,
if you will—copied the words of the motto from some
Spanish Emblem-book, or book of proverbs, that had come
within his observation, and which applied the saying to woman’s
gentleness subduing man’s harsher nature. Future inquirers
will, perhaps, clear up this little mystery, and trace the very
work in which the Spanish saying is original, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>Piu por dulzura
que por fuerza</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We pass to the third, the fourth, and the fifth knights, with
their “devices” and “words;” and to illustrate these we have
almost a superabundant wealth of emblem-lore, from any
portion of which Shakespeare may have made his choice. His
materials may have come from some one of the various editions
of Claude Paradin’s, or of Gabriel Symeoni’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Devises Heroiqves</span>,”</span>
which appeared at Lyons and Antwerp, in French and
Italian, between the years 1557 and 1590; or, as the learned
Francis Douce supposes, in his <cite>Illustrations of Shakspere</cite>,
pp. 302, 393, the dramatist may have seen the English translation
of these authors, which was published in London in
1591, or, with greater probability, as some are inclined to
say, he may have used the emblems of our countryman, Geffrey
Whitney. Were it not that Daniell’s translation, in 1585, of <cite>The
Worthy Tract of Paulus Jovius</cite> is without plates, we should
include this in the number.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the devices in question, Whitney’s volume contains two,
and the other works the three; but between certain expressions
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>of Whitney’s and those of the <cite>Pericles</cite>, the similarity is so great,
that the evidence of circumstance inclines, I may say decidedly
inclines, to the conclusion that for two out of the three emblems
referred to, Shakespeare was indebted to his fellow Elizabethan
poet, and not to a foreign source.</p>

<p class='c000'>From his use of Spanish and French mottoes, as well as
Latin, it is evident that Shakespeare, no more than Spenser,
needed the aid of translations to render the emblem treasures
available to himself; and if, as some maintain,<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a> the <cite>Pericles</cite>
was in existence previous to the year 1591, it could not have
been that use was made of the English translation of that date
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Devises Heroiqves</span>,”</span> by P. S.; it remains, therefore,
that for two out of the three emblems he must either have
employed one of the original editions of Lyons and of Antwerp,
or have been acquainted with our Whitney’s <cite>Choice of Emblemes</cite>,
and have obtained help from them; and for the third emblem
he must have gone to the French or Italian originals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third knight, named of Antioch, has for his device
“a wreath of chivalry,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The word, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Me pompæ provexit apex</em></span>;”—</div>
      <div class='c017'>(Act ii. sc. 2, l. 30,)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>i. e.</em>, “The crown at the triumphal procession has carried me onward.”
On the 146th leaf of Paradin’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Devises Heroiqves</span>,”</span>
edition Antwerp, 1562, the wreath and the motto are exactly as
Shakespeare describes them. But Paradin gives a long and
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>interesting account of the laurel-wreath, and of the high value
accorded to it in Roman estimation. “It was,” as that author
remarks, “the grandest
recompense, or the
grandest reward which
the ancient Romans
could think of to offer
to the Chieftains over
armies, to Emperors,
Captains, and victorious
Knights.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Symeoni (from edition Lyons, 1574, p. 200) adds this little
piece of history:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the battle of the Swiss, routed near Milan by King
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>Francis, M. de Saint Valier, the old man, father of Madame the
Duchess de Valentinois,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a> and captain of a hundred gentlemen
of the king’s house, bore a standard, whereon was painted a
lighted torch with the head downward, on which flowed so much
wax as would extinguish it, with this motto ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Qvi me alit, me
extingvit</span></span>,’ imitating the emblem of the king his master; that
is, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class='sc'>Nvtrisco et extingvo</span>.</span>’ It is the nature of the wax, which
is the cause of the torch burning when held upright, that with
the head downward it should be extinguished. Thus he wished
to signify, that as the beauty of a lady whom he loved nourished
all his thoughts, so she put him in peril of his life. See still
this standard in the church of the Celestins at Lyons.”<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c015'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Paradin, who confessedly copies from Symeoni, agrees very
nearly with this account, but gives the name of the Duchess
“Diane de Poitiers,” and omits mentioning “the emblem of the
king.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>As stated in the <em>fac-simile Reprint</em> of Whitney’s <cite>Emblemes</cite>,
p. 302, Douce in his <cite>Illustrations of Shakespeare</cite>, pp. 302, 393,
advances the opinion that the translation of Paradin into
English, 1591, by P. S., was the source of Shakespeare’s torch-emblem;
“but it is very note-worthy that the torch in the
English translation is not a torch ‘that’s turned upside down,’
but one held uninverted, with the flame naturally ascending.
This contrariety to Shakespeare’s description seems fatal therefore
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>to the translator’s claim.” P. S., however, renders the
motto, “He that nourisheth me, killeth me;” and so may put
in a claim to the suggestion
of the line,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Which can as well inflame as it can kill.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Let us next take
Whitney’s stanza of six
lines to the same motto
and the same device,
p. 183; premising that
the very same wood-block
appears to have
been used for the Paradin
in 1562, and for
the Whitney in 1586.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Even as the waxe dothe feede, and quenche the flame,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So, loue giues life; and loue, dispaire doth giue:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The godlie loue, doth louers croune with fame:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The wicked loue, in shame dothe make them liue.</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Then leaue to loue, or loue as reason will,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>For, louers lewde doe vainlie languishe still.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now, comparing together Symeoni, Paradin, Whitney, and
Shakespeare, as explanatory of the fourth knight’s emblem, we
can scarcely fail to perceive in the <cite>Pericles</cite> a closer resemblance,
both of thought and expression, to Whitney than to the other
two. Whitney wrote,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So, loue giues life; and loue, dispaire doth giue,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>which the <cite>Pericles</cite> thus amplifies:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Which shows, that beauty hath this power and will,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which can as well inflame as it can kill.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We conclude, therefore, from this instance, that Whitney’s
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span><cite>Choice of Emblemes</cite> was known to the author of the <cite>Pericles</cite>, and
that in this instance he has simply carried out the idea which
was there suggested to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>A slight allusion to this same device of the burning torch is
made in <cite>3 Henry VI.</cite> (act iii. sc. 2, l. 51, vol. v. p. 281), when
Clarence remarks,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As red as fire! nay, then her wax must melt;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>but a very distinct one in Hamlet’s words (act iii. sc. 4, l. 82,
vol. viii. p. 112),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</div>

      <div class='line'>And melt in her own fire; proclaim no shame</div>

gives the same variation in the reading of the motto as Shakespeare
does, namely, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quod”</span> for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Qui;”</span> and as Daniell had
done in <cite>The Worthy Tract of Paulus Jouius</cite>, in 1585, by substituting

<p class='c000'>“So is fidelity to be proved,”—occur
most exactly in Paradin’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Devises Heroiques</span>,”</span>
edition 1562, leaf 100, <em>reverse</em>;
they are here figured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paradin often presents an
account of the origin and
appropriation of his emblems,
but, in this instance, he offers only an application.  “If, in
order to prove fine gold, or other metals, we bring them to the
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>touch, without trusting to their glitter or their sound;—so, to
recognise good people and persons of virtue, it is needful to
observe the splendour of their deeds, without dwelling upon their
mere talk.”<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c015'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The narrative which Paradin neglects to give may be supplied
from other sources. This Emblem or Symbol is, in fact,
that which was appropriated to Francis I. and Francis II., kings
of France from 1515 to 1560, and also to one of the Henries—probably
Henry IV. The inscription on the coin, according to
Paradin and Whitney’s woodcut, is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Franciscvs Dei Gratia
Fran. Rex</span>;”</span> this is for Francis I.; but in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Hierographia
Regvm Francorvm</cite></span><a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a> (vol. i. pp. 87 and 88), the emblem is
inscribed, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Franciscus II. Valesius Rex Francorum XXV.
Christianissimus.”</span> A device similar to Paradin’s then follows,
and the comment, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Coronatum aureum nummum, ad Lydium
lapidem dextra hæc explicat &amp; sic, id est, duris in rebus fidem
explorandam docet</em></span>,—“This right hand extends to the Lydian
stone a coin of gold which is wreathed around, and so teaches that
fidelity in times of difficulty is put to the proof.” The coin applied
to the touchstone bears the inscription, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Franciscvs II. Francorv.
Rex</span>.”</span> An original drawing,<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a> by Crispin de Passe, in the
possession of Sir William Stirling Maxwell, Bart., of Keir,
presents the inscription in another form, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Henricvs, D. G.
Francorv. Rex</span>.”</span> The first work of Crispin de Passe is dated
1589, and Henry IV. was recognised king of France in 1593.
His portrait, and that of his queen, Mary of Medicis, were
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>painted by De Passe; and so the Henry on the coin in the
drawing above alluded to was Henry of Navarre.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole number of original drawings at Keir, by Crispin
de Passe, is thirty-five, of the size of the following plate,—No 27

<p class='c000'>The Emblem which Shakespeare attributes to the fifth knight
is fully described by Whitney (p. 139), with the same device and
the same motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Sic spectanda fides</em></span>,<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c015'><sup>[104]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>If, in the use of this device, and in their observations upon it,
Paradin, either in the original or in the English version, and
Whitney be compared with the lines on the subject in <cite>Pericles</cite>,
it will be seen “that Shakespeare did not derive his fifth knight’s
device either from the French emblem or from its English
translator, but from the English Whitney which had been
lately published. Indeed, if <cite>Pericles</cite> were written, as Knight
conjectures, in Shakespeare’s early manhood, previous to the
year 1591, it could not be the English translation of Paradin

Triumph Scene.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To the motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Amor certvs in re incerta cernitvr</span>,”</span>—<em>Certain
love is seen in an uncertain matter</em>,—Otho Vænius, in
his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Amorum Emblemata</cite></span>, 4to, Antwerp, 1608, represents two
Cupids at work, one trying gold in the furnace, the other on the
touchstone. His stanzas, published with an English translation,
as if intended for circulation in England, may, as we have conjectured,
have been seen by Shakespeare before 1609, when the
<cite>Pericles</cite> was revived. They are to the above motto,—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>The same metaphor of attesting characters, as gold is proved
by the touchstone or by the furnace, is of frequent occurrence in
Shakespeare’s undoubted plays; and sometimes the turn of the
thought is so like Whitney’s as to give good warrant for the
supposition, either of a common original, or that Shakespeare had
read the Emblems of our Cheshire poet and made use of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Isabella, too, in <cite>Measure for Measure</cite> (act ii. sc. 2, l. 149,

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In the dialogue from <cite>King John</cite> (act iii. sc. 1, l. 96, vol. iv.

is alluded to. King Philip says,—</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>“By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause</div>

      <div class='line'>Have I not pawn’d to you my majesty?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But Constance answers with great severity,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You have beguiled me with a counterfeit</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>One instance more shall close the subject;—it is from the
<cite>Coriolanus</cite> (act iv. sc. 1, l. 44, vol. vi. p. 369), and contains a very
fine allusion to the testing of true metal; the noble traitor is
addressing his mother Volumnia, his wife Virgilia, and others of
his kindred,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>“Fare ye well:</div>

      <div class='line'>That’s yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and</div>

      <div class='line'>Bid me farewell, and smile.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>So beautifully and so variously does the great dramatist carry
out that one thought of making trial of men’s hearts and characters
to learn the metal of which they are made.</p>

<p class='c007'>To finish our notices and illustrations of the Triumph Scene in
<cite>Pericles</cite>, there remain to be considered the device and the motto
of the sixth—the stranger knight—who “with such a graceful
courtesy delivered,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A wither’d branch, that’s only green at top,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c015'><sup>[105]</sup></a></div>

      <div class='c017'>(Act ii. sc. 2, lines 43, 44;)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and on which the remark is made by Simonides,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A pretty moral:</div>
      <div class='line'>From the dejected state wherein he is,</div>
      <div class='line'>He hopes by you his fortune yet may flourish.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>With these I have found nothing identical in any of the
various books of Emblems which I have examined; indeed, I
cannot say that I have met with anything similar. The sixth
knight’s emblem is very simple, natural, and appropriate; and I
am most of all disposed to regard it as invented by Shakespeare
himself to complete a scene, the greater part of which had been
accommodated from other writers.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Yet the sixth device and motto need not remain without illustration.
Hope is a theme which Emblematists could not possibly
omit. Alciatus gives a series of four Emblems on this virtue,—Emblems
43, 44, 45, and 46; Sambucus, three, with the mottoes
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Spes certa,”</span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In spe fortitudo,”</span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Spes aulica;”</span>
and Whitney, three from
Alciatus (pp. 53, 137, and
139); but none of these can
be accepted as a proper
illustration of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>In hac
spe vivo</em></span>. Their inapplicability
may be judged of
from Alciat’s 46th Emblem,
very closely followed by
Whitney (p. 139).</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spirit, however,
if not in the words of the
sixth knight’s device, the
Emblem writers have fashioned
their  thoughts.
From Paradin’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Devises
Heroiqves</span>,”</span>  so  often
quoted, we select two devices
(fol. 30 and 152) illustrative of our subject. The one, an
arrow issuing from a tomb, on which is the sign of the cross,
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>and having verdant shoots twined around it, was the emblem
which Madame Diana of Poitiers adopted to express her
strong hope of a resurrection from the dead;<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c015'><sup>[106]</sup></a> and the same
hope is also shadowed forth by ears of corn growing out of
a collection of dry bones, and ripening and shedding their seed.</p>

<div id='i076'  class='figright id040'>
<img src='images/img076.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Paradin, 1562.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The first, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Sola viuit in
illo</em></span>,—“Alone on that,” <em>i.e.</em>,
on the cross, “she lives,”—we
now offer with Paradin’s
explanation; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>L’esperance
que Madame Diane de Poitiers
Illustre Duchesse de
Valentinois, a de la resurrection,
&amp; que son noble
esprit, contemplant les cieus
en cette view, paruiendra en
l’autre après la mort: est
possible signifié par sa Deuise,
qui est d’vn Sercueil,
ou tombeau, duquel sort vn
trait, acompagné de certains
syons verdoyans.</em>”</span> <em>i.e.</em>,—“The hope which Madame Diana of
Poitiers, the illustrious Duchess de Valentinois, has of the resurrection,
and which her noble spirit, contemplating the heavens
in this life, will arrive at in the other, after death: it is really
signified by her Device, which is a Sepulchre or tomb, from
which issues an arrow, accompanied by certain verdant shoots.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The motto of the second is more directly to the purpose, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Spes
altera vitæ</em></span>,—“Another hope of life,” or “The hope of another
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>life,”—and its application is thus explained by Paradin (leaf 151
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>reverso</em></span>),—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>Les grains des Bleds, &amp; autres herbages, semées &amp;
mortifiées en terre, se reuerdoyent, &amp; prennent nouuel accroissement:
aussi les corps humains tombãs par Mort, seront relevés en gloire,

herbs, sown and dying in the ground, become green again, and
take new growth: so human bodies cast down by Death will be
raised again in glory, by the general resurrection.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We omit the woodcut which Paradin gives, and substitute for
it the 100th Emblem, part i. p. 102, from Joachim Camerarius,
edition, 1595, which bears the very same motto and device.</p>

<p class='c000'>At present we must be content to say that the source of the
motto and device of the sixth knight has not been discovered.
It remains for us to conjecture, what is very far from being an
improbability, that Shakespeare had read Spenser’s <cite>Shepherd’s
Calendar</cite>, published in 1579, and from the line, on page 364 of
Moxon’s edition, for January (l. 54),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ah, God! that love should breed both ioy and paine!”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and from the Emblem, as Spenser names it, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Anchora speme</em></span>,—“Hope
is my anchor,”—did invent for himself the sixth knight’s
device, and its motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>In hac spe vivo</em></span>,—“In this hope I live.”
The step from applying so suitably the Emblems of other
writers to the construction of new ones would not be great; and
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>from what he has actually done in the invention of Emblems in
the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> he would experience very little trouble
in contriving any Emblem that he needed for the completion of
his dramatic plans.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Casket</em> Scene and the <em>Triumph</em> Scene then justify our
conclusion that the correspondencies between Shakespeare and
the Emblem writers which preceded him are very direct and
complete. It is to be accepted as a fact that he was acquainted
with their works, and profited so much from them, as to be able,
whenever the occasion demanded, to invent and most fittingly
illustrate devices of his own. The spirit of Alciat was upon
him, and in the power of that spirit he pictured forth the ideas
to which his fancy had given birth.</p>

HAVING established the facts that Shakespeare
invented and described Emblems of his own,
and that he plainly and palpably adopted
several which had been designed by earlier
authors, we may now, with more consistency, enter on the
further labour of endeavouring to trace to their original
sources the various hints and allusions, be they more or less
express, which his sonnets and dramas contain in reference
to Emblem literature. And we may bear in mind that we
are not now proceeding on mere conjecture; we have dug
into the virgin soil and have found gold that can bear
every test, and may reasonably expect, as we continue our
industry, to find a nugget here and a nugget there to reward
our toil.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the correspondencies and parallelisms existing in
Shakespeare between himself and the earlier Emblematists
are so numerous, that it becomes requisite to adopt some
system of arrangement, or of classification, lest a mere chaos
of confusion and not the symmetry of order should reign
over our enterprise. And as “all Emblemes for the most
part,” says Whitney to his readers, “maie be reduced into
these three kindes, which is <em>Historicall</em>, <em>Naturall</em>, &amp; <em>Morall</em>,”
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>we shall make that division of his our foundation, and considering
the various instances of imitation or of adaptation
to be met with in Shakespeare, shall arrange them under the
<em>eight</em> heads of—1, Historical Emblems; 2, Heraldic Emblems;
3, Emblems of Mythological Characters; 4, Emblems illustrative
of Fables; 5, Emblems in connexion with Proverbs;
6, Emblems from Facts in Nature, and from the Properties of
Animals; 7, Emblems for Poetic Ideas; and 8, Moral and
Æsthetic, and Miscellaneous Emblems.</p>

AS soon as learning revived in Europe, the great
models of ancient times were again set up on
their pedestals for admiration and for guidance.
Nearly all the Elizabethan authors,
certainly those of highest fame, very frequently introduce, or
expatiate upon, the worthies of Greece and Rome,—both
those which are named in the epic poems of Homer and
Virgil, and those which are within the limits of authentic
history. It seemed enough to awaken interest, “to point
a moral, or adorn a tale,” that there existed a record
of old.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare, though cultivating, it may be, little direct
acquaintance with the classical writers, followed the general
practice. He has built up some of the finest of his Tragedies,
if not with chorus, and semi-chorus, strophe, anti-strophe,
and epode, like the Athenian models, yet with a
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>wonderfully exact appreciation of the characters of antiquity,
and with a delineating power surprisingly true to history and
to the leading events and circumstances in the lives of the
personages whom he introduces. From possessing full and
adequate scholarship, Giovio, Domenichi, Claude Mignault,
Whitney, and others of the Emblem schools, went immediately
to the original sources of information. Shakespeare,
we may admit, could do this only in a limited degree, and
generally availed himself of assistance from the learned translators
of ancient authors. Most marvellously does he transcend
them in the creative attributes of high genius: they supplied
the rough marble, blocks of Parian perchance, and a few
tools more or less suited to the work; but it was himself,
his soul and intellect and good right arm, which have produced
almost living and moving forms,—</p>

<p class='c000'>The two emblems of Medeia and of Æneas and Anchises,
Shakespeare, in <cite>2 Henry VI.</cite> (act. v. sc. 2, l. 45, vol. v. p. 218),
brings into close juxta-position, and unites by a single description;
it is, when young Clifford comes upon the dead body of
his valiant father, stretched on the field of St. Albans, and bears
it lovingly on his shoulders. With strong filial affection he
addresses the mangled corpse,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in11'>“Wast thou ordain’d, dear father,</div>

      <div class='line'>And, in thy reverence, and thy chair-days, thus</div>
      <div class='line'>To die in ruffian battle?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>On the instant the purpose of vengeance enters his mind, and
fiercely he declares,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'>“Even at this sight,</div>

      <div class='line'>No more will I their babes: tears virginal</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall be to me even as the dew to fire;</div>
      <div class='line'>And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.</div>

      <div class='line'>In cruelty will I seek out my fame.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then suddenly there comes a gush of feeling, and with most
exquisite tenderness he adds,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford’s house:</div>

atrocious crimes against Lavinia the daughter of Titus, are
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>bound, and preparations are made to inflict such punishment

<p class='c000'>In several instances in his historical plays, Shakespeare very
expressly refers to this fable. On hearing that some of his
nobles had made peace with Bolingbroke, in <cite>Richard II.</cite> (act. iii.
sc. 2, l. 129, vol. iv. p. 168), the king exclaims,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O villains, vipers, damn’d without redemption!</div>
      <div class='line'>Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!</div>
      <div class='line'>Snakes, in my heart blood warm’d that sting my heart!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the same drama (act. v. sc. 3, l. 57, vol. iv. p. 210) York urges
Bolingbroke,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And another, bearing the name of York, in <cite>2 Henry VI.</cite> (act.
iii. sc. 1, l. 343, vol. v. p. 162), declares to the nobles,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I fear me, you but warm the starved snake,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, cherish’d in your breasts, will sting your hearts.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Also Hermia, <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> (act. ii. sc. 2, l. 145,
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>vol. ii. p. 225), when awakened from her trance-like sleep, calls
on her beloved,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best</div>
      <div class='line'>To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whitney combines Freitag’s and Reusner’s Emblems under
one motto (p. 189), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>In sinu alere serpentem</em></span>,—“To nourish a
serpent in the bosom,”—but applies them to the siege of
Antwerp in 1585 in a way which Schiller’s famous history
fully confirms:<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c015'><sup>[112]</sup></a>—“The government of the citizens was
shared among too many hands, and too strongly influenced
by a disorderly populace to allow any one to consider with
calmness, to decide with judgment, or to execute with firmness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The typical Sinon is here introduced by Whitney,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thovghe, cittie stronge the cannons shotte dispise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And deadlie foes, beseege the same in vaine:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, in the walles if pining famine rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or else some impe of <span class='sc'>Sinon</span>, there remaine.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What can preuaile your bulwarkes? and your towers,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When, all your force, your inwarde foe deuoures.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In fact, Sinon seems to have been the accepted representative
of treachery in every form; for when Camillus,
at the siege of Faleria, rewarded the Schoolmaster as he
deserved for attempting to give up his scholars into captivity,
the occurence is thus described in the <cite>Choice of Emblemes</cite>,
p. 113,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With that, hee caus’de this <span class='sc'>Sinon</span> to bee stripte,</div>
      <div class='line'>And whippes, and roddes, vnto the schollers gaue:</div>
      <div class='line'>Whome, backe againe, into the toune they whipte.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>Shakespeare is even more frequent in his allusions to this
same Sinon. The <cite>Rape of Lucrece</cite>, published in 1594, speaks of
him as “the perjured Sinon,” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“the false Sinon,”</span> “the subtle
Sinon,” and avers (vol. ix. p. 537, l. 1513),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“Like a constant and confirmed devil,</div>
      <div class='line'>He entertain’d a show so seeming just,</div>
      <div class='line'>And therein so ensconc’d his secret evil,—</div>
      <div class='line'>That jealousy itself could not mistrust,</div>
      <div class='line'>False creeping craft and perjury should thrust</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Also in <cite>3 Henry VI.</cite> (act. iii. sc. 2, l. 188, vol. v. p. 285), and in
<cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> (act. v. sc. 3, l. 85, vol. vi. p. 527), we read,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’ll play the orator as well as Nestor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could,</div>
      <div class='line'>And like a Sinon, take another Troy;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch’d our ears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or who hath brought the fatal engine in</div>
      <div class='line'>That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But in <cite>Cymbeline</cite> (act. iii. sc. 4, l. 57, vol. ix. p. 226), Æneas is
joined in almost the same condemnation with Sinon. Pisano
expostulates with Imogen,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Pis.</em><span style="margin-left: 8em;">Good madam, hear me.</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Imo.</em> True honest men being heard, like false Æneas,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were in his time thought false; and Sinon’s weeping</div>
      <div class='line'>Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity</div>
      <div class='line'>From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;</div>
      <div class='line'>Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured</div>
      <div class='line'>From thy great fail.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Doubtless it will be said that such allusions to the characters
in classical history are the common property of the whole
modern race of literary men, and that to make them implies no
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>actual copying by later writers of those who preceded them in
point of time; still in the examples just given there are such
coincidences of expression, not merely of idea, as justify the
opinion that Shakespeare both availed himself of the usual
sources of information, and had read and taken into his mind
the very colour of thought which Whitney had lately spread
over the same subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great Roman names, Curtius, Cocles, Manlius and
Fabius gave Whitney the opportunity for saying (p. 109),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With these, by righte comes <em>Coriolanus</em> in,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose cruell minde did make his countrie smarte;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till mothers teares, and wiues, did pittie winne.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And these few lines, in fact, are a summary of the plot and chief
incidents of Shakespeare’s play of <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, so that it is far
from being unlikely that they may have been the germ, the very
seed-bed of that vigorous offset of his genius. Almost the exact
blame which Whitney imputes is also attributed to Coriolanus
by his mother Volumnia (act. v. sc. 3, l. 101, vol. vi. p. 407), who
charges him with,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Making the mother, wife and child, to see</div>
      <div class='line'>The son, the husband and the father, tearing</div>
      <div class='line'>His country’s bowels out.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And when wife and mother have conquered his strong hatred
against his native land (act. v. sc. 3, l. 206, vol. vi. p. 411),
Coriolanus observes to them,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in15'>“Ladies, you deserve</div>
      <div class='line'>To have a temple built you: all the swords</div>
      <div class='line'>In Italy, and her confederate arms,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could not have made this peace.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The subject of Alciat’s 119th Emblem, edition 1581, p. 430,
is the <cite>Death of Brutus</cite>, with the motto,—</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>On the ideas here suggested Whitney enlarges, p. 70, and
writes,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When <span class='sc'>Brvtvs</span> knewe, <span class='sc'>Avgvstvs</span> parte preuail’de,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sawe his frendes, lie bleedinge on the grounde,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such deadlie griefe, his noble harte assail’de,</div>
      <div class='line'>That with his sworde, hee did him selfe confounde:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But firste, his frendes perswaded him to flee,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Whoe aunswer’d thus, my flighte with handes shalbee.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And bending then to blade, his bared breste,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hee did pronounce, theise wordes with courage great:</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh Prowes vaine, I longe did loue thee beste,</div>
      <div class='line'>But nowe I see, thou doest on fortune waite.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Wherefore with paine, I nowe doe prouue it true,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That fortunes force, maie valiant hartes subdue.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>So, in the <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> (act. v. sc. 5, l. 25, vol. vii. p. 413),
the battle of Philippi being irretrievably lost to the party of the
Republic, and Marcus Cato slain, Brutus, meditating self-destruction,
desires aid from one of his friends that he may
accomplish his purpose,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in21'>“Good Volumnius,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou know’st that we two went to school together:</div>
      <div class='line'>Even for that our love of old, I prithee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Vol.</em> That’s not an office for a friend, my lord.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The alarum continues,—the friends of Brutus again remonstrate,
and Clitus urges him to escape (l. 30),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Cli.</em> Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Bru.</em> Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.</div>
      <div class='line'>Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;</div>
      <div class='line'>Farewell to thee, too, Strato. Countrymen,</div>
      <div class='line'>My heart doth joy that yet in all my life</div>
      <div class='line'>I found no man but he was true to me.</div>
      <div class='line'>I shall have glory by this losing day,</div>
      <div class='line'>More than Octavius and Mark Antony</div>
      <div class='line'>By this vile contest shall attain unto.</div>
      <div class='line'>So, fare you well at once; for Brutus’ tongue</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath almost ended his life’s history:</div>
      <div class='line'>Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>That have but labour’d to attain this hour.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Once more is the alarum raised,—“Fly, fly, fly.” “Hence, I
will follow thee,” is the hero’s answer; but when friends are gone,
he turns to one of his few attendants, and entreats (l. 44),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:</div>
      <div class='line'>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</div>
      <div class='line'>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Stra.</em> Give me your hand first: fare you well, my lord.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Bru.</em> Farewell, good Strato. [<em>Runs on his sword.</em>] Cæsar, now be still:</div>
      <div class='line'>I kill’d not thee with half so good a will.<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<em>Dies.</em>]”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>In the presence of the conquerors Strato then declares,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</div>
      <div class='line'>For Brutus only overcame himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>And no man else hath honour by his death.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Lucil.</em> So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,</div>
      <div class='line'>That thou hast proved Lucilius’ saying true.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And we must mark how finely the dramatist represents the
victors at Philippi testifying to the virtues of their foe (l. 68),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Antony.</em> This was the noblest Roman of them all:</div>
      <div class='line'>All the conspirators, save only he,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did that they did in envy of great Cæsar;</div>
      <div class='line'>He only, in a general honest thought</div>
      <div class='line'>And common good to all, made one of them.</div>
      <div class='c011'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>

      <div class='line'>With all respect and rites of burial.</div>
      <div class='line'>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Most like a soldier, order’d honourably.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The mode of the catastrophe differs slightly in the two
writers; and undoubtedly, in this as in most other instances,
there is a very wide difference between the life and spiritedness
of the dramatist, and the comparative lameness of the Emblem
writers,—the former instinct with the fire of genius, the latter
seldom rising above an earth-bound mediocrity; yet the
references or allusions by the later poet to the earlier can
scarcely be questioned; they are too decided to be the results
of pure accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one instance Whitney (p. 110, l. 32) hits off the characteristics
of Brutus and Cassius in a single line,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With <em>Brutus</em> boulde, and <em>Cassius</em>, pale and wan.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>It is remarkable how Shakespeare amplifies these two epithets,
“pale and wan” into a full description of the personal manner
and appearance of Cassius. Cæsar and his train have re-entered
upon the scene, and (act. i. sc. 2, l. 192, vol. vii. p. 329) the
dictator haughtily and satirically gives order,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Cæs.</em> Let me have men about me that are fat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o’ nights:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</div>
      <div class='line'>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Ant.</em> Fear him not, Cæsar; he’s not dangerous;</div>
      <div class='line'>He is a noble Roman, and well given.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Cæs.</em> Would he were fatter! but I fear him not:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>I do not know the man I should avoid</div>
      <div class='line'>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</div>
      <div class='line'>He is a great observer, and he looks</div>
      <div class='line'>Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</div>
      <div class='line'>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</div>
      <div class='line'>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</div>
      <div class='line'>As if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit</div>
      <div class='line'>That could be moved to smile at any thing.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such men as he be never at heart’s ease</div>
      <div class='line'>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore are they very dangerous.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Pale and wan,”—two most fruitful words, certainly, to bring
forth so graphic a description of men that are “very dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of names historic the Emblem writers give a great many
examples, but only a few, within the prescribed boundaries of
our subject, that are at the same time historic and Shakespearean.</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Vel post mortem formidolosi</em></span>,—“Even after death to be
dreaded,”—is the sentiment with which Alciatus (Emblem 170),
and Whitney after him (p. 194), associate the noisy drum and
the shrill-sounding horn; and thus the Emblem-classic illustrates
his device,—</p>

<p class='c000'>Five or six instances may be found in which Shakespeare
introduces the word “lottery;” and, historically, the word is
deserving of notice,—for it was in his boyhood that the first
public lottery was set on foot in England; and judging from the
nature of the prizes, he appears to have made allusion to them.
There were 40,000 chances,—according to Bohn’s <cite>Standard
Library Cyclopædia</cite>, vol. iii. p. 279,—sold at ten shillings each:
“The prizes consisted of articles of plate, and the profit was
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>employed for the repair of certain harbours.” The drawing took
place at the west door of St. Paul’s Cathedral; it began “23rd
January, 1569, and continued incessantly drawing, <em>day and night</em>,
till the 6th of May following.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c015'><sup>[115]</sup></a> How such an event should find
its record in a Book of
Emblems may at first be
accounted strange; but in
addition to her other mottoes,
Queen Elizabeth had,
on this occasion of the
lottery, chosen a special
motto, which Whitney (p.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Silence, also, was represented by the image of the goddess
Ageniora. In an Emblem-book by Peter Costalius, <cite>Pegma</cite>,
edition Lyons, 1555, p. 109, he refers to her example, and concludes
his stanza with the words, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Si sapis à nostra disce tacere
dea</em></span>,—“If thou art wise, learn from our goddess to be silent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That Casket Scene in the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> (act i. sc. 2, l. 24),—from
which we have already made long extracts,—contains a
reference to lotteries quite in character with the prizes, “articles
of plate and rich jewelry.” Portia is deeming it hard, that
according to her father’s will, she “may neither choose whom
she would, nor refuse whom she disliked.” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Is it not hard,
Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?”</span></p>

<p class='c027'>“<em>Ner.</em> Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men, at their death, have
good inspirations: therefore, the lottery, that he hath devised in these three
chests of gold, silver, and lead,—whereof who chooses his meaning chooses
you—will, no doubt, never be chosen by any rightly, but one who shall
rightly love.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince of Morocco (act ii. sc. 1, l. 11) affirms to Portia,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in15'>“I would not change this hue,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>and Portia answers,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In terms of choice I am not solely led</div>

      <div class='line'>Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The prevalence of lotteries, too, seems to be intimated by the
Clown in <cite>All’s Well that Ends Well</cite> (act i. sc. 3, l. 73, vol. iii.
p. 123), when he repeats the song,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Among nine bad if one be good,</div>
      <div class='line'>Among nine bad if one be good,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There’s yet one good in ten;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and the Countess reproving him says,—</p>

<p class='c027'>  “What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.</p>

<p class='c026'>  <em>Clo.</em> One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o’ the song:
would God would serve the world so all the year! we’d find no fault with the
tithe-woman, if I were the parson: one in ten, quoth a’! an’ we might have
a good woman born but one every blazing star, or at an earthquake, ’twould
mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a’ pluck one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare’s words will receive a not inapt illustration from
the sermon of a contemporary prelate, Dr. Chatterton, Bishop of
Chester from 1579 to 1595, and to whom Whitney dedicated
the Emblem on p. 120, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Vigilantia et custodia</em></span>,—“Watchfulness
and guardianship.”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c015'><sup>[118]</sup></a> He was preaching a wedding sermon in
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>Cambridge, and Ormerod, i. p. 146, quoting King’s <cite>Vale Royal</cite>,
tells us,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“He used this merry comparison. The choice of a wife is full of hazard,
not unlike to a man groping for one fish in a barrel full of serpents: if he
escape harm of the snakes, and light on the fish, he may be thought fortunate;
yet let him not boast, for perhaps it may be but an eel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That “good woman” “to mend the lottery well,” that “one
fish in a barrel full of serpents,” came, however, to the chance of
one of Cæsar’s friends. Even when Antony (<cite>Antony and Cleopatra</cite>,
act ii. sc. 2, l. 245, vol. ix. p. 40) was under the witchery
of the “rare Egyptian queen,” that “did make defect, perfection,”
the dramatist says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle</div>
      <div class='line'>The heart of Antony, Octavia is</div>
      <div class='line'>A blessed lottery to him.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Emblems applicable to Shakespeare’s historical characters
are only a few among the numbers that occur in the
Emblem writers, as Alciat, Cousteau, Giovio, Symeoni, &amp;c.: but
our choice is limited, and there would be no pertinency in
selecting devices to which in the dramas of our author there are
no corresponding expressions of thought, though there may be
parallelisms of subject.</p>

KNOTTED together as are Emblems and
the very language of Heraldry, we must
expect to find Emblem writers devoting
some at least of their inventions to
heraldic purposes. This has been done
to a very considerable extent by the
Italians, especially by Paolo Giovio,
Domenichi, Ruscelli, and Symeoni; but in several other
authors also there occur heraldic devices among their more
general emblems. These are not full coats of arms and the
complete emblazonnes of “the gentleman’s science,” but rather
cognizances, or badges, by which persons and families of note
may be distinguished. In this respect Shakespeare entirely
agrees with the Emblem writers; neither he nor they give us
the quarterings complete, but they single out for honourable
mention some prominent mark or sign.</p>

<p class='c000'>I attempt not to arrange the subject according to the Rules
of the Art, but to exhibit instances in which Shakespeare
and the Emblematists agree, of Poetic Heraldry, the Heraldry
of Reward for Heroic Achievements, and the Heraldry of
Imaginative Devices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of Poetic Heraldry the chief type is that bird of renown,
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>which was a favourite with Shakespeare, and from which he has
been named by general consent, “the Swan of Avon.” A white
swan upon a shield occurs both in Alciat and in Whitney, and is
expressly named <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Insignia Poetarum</cite></span>,—“The poets’ ensigns.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The swan, in fact, was sacred to Apollo and the Muses; and
hence was supposed to be musical. Æschylus, in his <cite>Agamemnon,</cite>
makes Cassandra speak of the fable, when the Chorus
bewail her sad destiny (vv. 1322, 3),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ἃπαξ ἔπ’ εἰπεῖν ῥῆσιν ἢ θρῆνον θέλω</div>
      <div class='line'>ἐμὸν τὸν αὐτῆς.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>i.e.</em>,—“Yet once again I wish for her to speak forth prophecy or
lamentation, even my own,”—and Clytæmnēstra mentions the
singing of the swan at the point of death (vv. 1444–7),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ὁ μὲν γὰρ οὕτως· ἡ δέ τοι κύκνου δίκην</div>

  </div>

<p class='c000'>Which is to this effect: that when she has sung the last mortal

<p class='c000'>This notion of the singing
of the swan is to be traced
even to the hieroglyphics of
Egypt. In answer to the question,
“Πῶς γέροντα μουσικόν·”—how
to represent “an old man
musical?”—Horapollo, edition
Paris, 1551, p. 136, replies,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ιἐροντα μουσικὸν βουλόμενοι σημῇναι, κύκνον ζωγραφοῦσιν. οὑ~τος γαρ ἡδύτατον μέλος

bird sings its sweetest melody when growing old.”
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>Virgil frequently speaks of swans, both as melodious and as

<p class='c000'>Poets, too, after death, were fancifully supposed to assume

day of his execution. (See <cite>Phædon</cite>, Francfort edition, 1602,
p. 77, 64A.) They were fearful of causing him trouble and vexation;
but he reminds them they should not think him inferior in
foresight to the swans; for these,—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>“Fall a singing, as soon as they perceive that they are about to die, and
sing far more sweetly than at any former time, being glad that they are about
to go away to the God whose servants they are.... They possess the
power of prophesying, and foreseeing the blessings of Hades they sing and
rejoice exceedingly. Now I imagine that I am also a fellow-servant with the
Swans and sacred to the same God, and that I have received from the same
Master a power of foresight not inferior to theirs, so that I could depart from
life itself with a mind no more cast down.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the melodious dirge of the swan was attributed to the
same kind of prescience which enables good men to look forward
with delight to that time “when this mortal shall put on
immortality.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Picta Poesis</span>,”</span> p. 28, adopts the same fancy of the
swan singing at the end of life, but makes it the emblem of “old
age eloquent.” Thus,—</p>

<p class='c018'><em>i.e.</em>—“At the end of life tuneful is the bird, the white swan, into which the

hoariness and the sweet singing, old men illustrious for virtue and for eloquence.
Old wine is sweet; of an old man sweet is the speech; sweeter,
for this very cause, the wiser it is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare himself adopts this notion in the <cite>Merchant of
Venice</cite> (act i. sc. 2, l. 24, vol. ii. p. 286), when he says, “Holy
men at their death have good inspirations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Reusner, however, luxuriating in every variety of silvery and
snowy whiteness, represents the swan as especially the symbol of
the <em>pure simplicity of truth</em>. (<cite>Emblemata</cite>, lib. ii. 31, pp. 91, 92,

<p class='c018'><em>i.e.</em>—“Than a white swan what is brighter,—than silver, snow, the lily, the
privet? Bright faith and bright morals,—and the bright mind of a bright
companion. That thou of good morals, O Schedius Melissus, dost possess
snow-like faith, and the bright mind of an uncorrupted companion;—that
(thou art) more fair than the snowy privet,—more blessed than the snowy
silver,—more fragrant than the white lilies,—more comely than the little
bright swans,—the snowy swan on thy arms doth teach: a swan handsome
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>with white lilies, encircled as to its features with the laurel of Phœbus; a
swan brighter than the white privet,—more precious than the blessed silver;
to which cannot be equalled the comeliness of ivory, or of gold; nor the
worth and the splendour of a beautiful gem: and if in the world there is any
thing more beautiful still.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To a short, but very learned dissertation on the subject, and
to the device of a swan on a tomb, in his work, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Volatilibus</cite></span>,
edition 1595, Emb. 23, Joachim Camerarius affixes the motto,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Sibi canit et orbi</span>,”</span>—<em>It sings for itself and for the world</em>,—</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare’s expressions, however, as to the swan, correspond
more closely with the stanzas of Alciat (edition
Lyons, 1551, p. 197) which are contained in the woodcut on
next page.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whitney (p. 126) adopts the same ideas, but enlarges upon

<p class='c000'>In the very spirit of these Emblems of the Swan, the great
dramatist fashions some of his poetical images and most tender
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>descriptions. Thus in <cite>King John</cite> (act v. sc. 7, lines 1–24,
vol. iv. p. 91), in the Orchard Scene at Swinstead Abbey,
the king being in his mortal sickness, Prince Henry demands,
“Doth he still rage?” And Pembroke replies,—</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“He is more patient</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'><em>P. Hen.</em> O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes</div>
      <div class='line'>In their continuance will not feel themselves.</div>
      <div class='line'>Death, having prey’d upon the outward parts,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds</div>
      <div class='line'>With many legions of strange fantasies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which in their throng and press to that last hold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that death should sing.</div>
      <div class='line'>I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,</div>
      <div class='line'>And from the organ pipe of frailty sings</div>
      <div class='line'>His soul and body to their lasting rest.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To the same purport, in <cite>Henry VIII.</cite> (act iv. sc. 2, l. 77,
vol. vi. p. 88), are the words of Queen Katharine, though she
does not name the poet’s bird,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,</div>

      <div class='line'>On that celestial harmony I go to.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And in the Casket Scene, so often alluded to (<cite>Merchant of
Venice</cite>, act iii. sc. 2, l. 41, vol. ii. p. 325), when Bassanio is about
to try his fortune, Portia thus addresses him,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If you do love me, you will find me out.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let music sound while he doth make his choice;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fading in music: that the comparison</div>
      <div class='line'>May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream,</div>
      <div class='line'>And watery death-bed for him. He may win;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>And what is music then? Then music is</div>
      <div class='line'>Even as the flourish when true subjects bow</div>
      <div class='line'>To a new-crowned monarch: such it is</div>
      <div class='line'>As are those dulcet sounds in break of day</div>
      <div class='line'>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear</div>
      <div class='line'>And summon him to marriage.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the sad ending, too, of the <cite>Moor of Venice</cite> (act v. sc. 2,

      <div class='line'>I’d not have sold her for it:”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and the full proof of innocence having been brought forward,
Emilia desires to be laid by her dead “Mistress’ side,” and
inquires mournfully (l. 249, p. 586),—</p>

<p class='c000'>After this long dissertation <em>anent</em> swans, there may be
readers who will press hard upon me with the couplet from
Coleridge,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Swans sing before they die: ’twere no bad thing,</div>

<p class='c000'>From Heraldry itself the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> (act iii.
sc. 2, l. 201, vol. ii. p. 239) borrows one of its most beautiful
comparisons; it is in the passage where Helena so passionately
reproaches Hermia for supposed treachery,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in15'>“O, is all forgot?</div>
      <div class='line'>All school-days’ friendship, childhood innocence?</div>
      <div class='line'>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</div>

      <div class='line'>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</div>
      <div class='line'>Both warbling of one song, both in one key;</div>
      <div class='line'>As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had been incorporate. So we grew together,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted;</div>
      <div class='line'>But yet an union in partition,</div>
      <div class='line'>Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;</div>
      <div class='line'>So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In speaking of the Heraldry of Heroic Achievements, we
may refer to the “wreath of chivalry” (p. 168), already
described from the <cite>Pericles</cite>. There were, however, other
wreaths which the Romans bestowed as the rewards of great
and noble exploits. Several of these are set forth by the
Emblem writers; we will select one from Whitney (p. 115),
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Fortiter &amp; feliciter</em></span>,—“Bravely and happily.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>To this device of an armed hand grasping a spear, on which

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Marc Sergivs</span> nowe, I maye recorde by righte,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Of such honours, like poets generally, Shakespeare often
tells. After the triumph at Barnet (<cite>3 Henry VI.</cite>, act v. sc. 3,
l. 1, vol. v. p. 324), King Edward says to his friends,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Wreaths of honour and of victory are figured by Joachim
Camerarius, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Ex Re Herbaria</span>,”</span> edition 1590, in the 99th
Emblem. The laurel, the oak, and the olive garlands are
ringed together; the motto being, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>His ornari avt mori</span>,”</span>—<em>With

<p class='c000'>Among other illustrations are quoted the words of the <cite>Iliad,</cite>
which are applied to Hector, τεθνάτω, οὔ οἱ ἀεικὲς ἀμυνομένω περὶ

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>Of the three crowns two are named (<cite>3 Henry VI.</cite>, act iv.

<p class='c000'>The introduction to <cite>King Richard III.</cite> (act i. sc. 1, l. 1, vol. v.

      <div class='line'>“Now is the winter of our discontent</div>

      <div class='line'>In the deep bosom of the ocean bury’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Sun of York” is a direct allusion to the heraldic cognizance
which Edward IV. adopted, “in memory,” we are told, “of the
<em>three suns</em>,” which are said to have appeared at the battle which
he gained over the Lancastrians at Mortimer’s Cross. Richard
then adds,—</p>

<p class='c000'>We meet, too, in the <cite>Pericles</cite> (act ii. sc. 3, l. 9, vol. ix. p. 345)
with the words of Thaisa to the victor,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But you, my knight and guest;</div>

      <div class='line'>And crown you king of this day’s happiness.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But in the pure Roman manner, and according to the usage
of Emblematists, Shakespeare also tells of “victors’ crowns;”
following, as would appear, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Les Devises Heroiqves</span>”</span> of
Paradin, edition Anvers, 1562, f. 147 <em>verso</em>, which contains
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>several instances of garlands for noble brows. Of these, one is
entitled, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Seruati gratia ciuis</em></span>,—“For sake of a citizen saved.”</p>

<div id='i096'  class='figleft id039'>
<img src='images/img096.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The garland is thus
described in Paradin’s
French,—</p>

<p class='c018'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>La Courõne, apellee Ciuique,
eſtoit dõnee par le Citoyẽ, au Citoyẽ
qu’il auoit ſauué en guerre: en
repreſentatiõ de vie ſauuee. Et
eſtoit cete Courõne, tiſſue de
fueilles, ou petis rameaus de
Cheſne: pour autãt qu’au Cheſne,
la vielle antiquité, ſouloit prẽdre
ſa ſubſtãce, ſõ mãger, ou sa
nourriture</em>.”</span></p>

<p class='c019'><em>i.e.</em>—“The crown called Civic
was given by the Citizen to
the Citizen<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c015'><sup>[122]</sup></a> whom he had
saved in war; in testimony of
life saved. And this Crown was an inweaving of leaves or small branches
of Oak; inasmuch as from the Oak, old antiquity was accustomed to take
its subsistence, its food, or its nourishment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Among the rewards” for the Roman soldiery, remarks
Eschenburg (<cite>Manual of Classical Literature</cite>, p. 274), “golden or
gilded crowns were particularly common; as, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>corona castrensis</em></span>,
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vallaris</em></span>, to him who first entered the enemy’s entrenchments;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>corona muralis</em></span>, to him who first scaled the enemy’s
walls; and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>corona navalis</em></span>, for seizing a vessel of the enemy in a
sea-fight; also wreaths and crowns formed of leaves and blossoms;
as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>corona civica</em></span>, of oak leaves, conferred for freeing a citizen
from death or captivity at the hands of the enemy; the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>corona
obsidionalis</em></span>, of grass, for delivering a besieged city; and the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>corona triumphalis</em></span>, of laurel, worn by a triumphing general.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>Shakespeare’s acquaintance with these Roman customs we
find, where we should expect it to be, in the <cite>Coriolanus</cite> and in
the <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>. Let us take the instances; first, from the
<cite>Coriolanus</cite>, act i. sc. 9, l. 58, vol. vi. p. 304; act i. sc. 3, l. 7,
p. 287; act ii. sc. 2, l. 84, p. 323; and act ii. sc. 1, l. 109, p. 312.
Cominius thanks the gods that “our Rome hath such a soldier”
as Caius Marcius, and declares (act i. sc. 9, l. 58),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“Therefore, be it known,</div>

      <div class='line'>My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,</div>

      <div class='line'>The addition nobly ever!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>With most motherly pride Volumnia rehearses the brave
deed to Virgilia, her son’s wife (act i. sc. 3, l. 7),—</p>

<p class='c018'>“When, for a day of kings’ entreaties, a mother should not sell him an
hour from her beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a
person; that it was no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if renown
made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find
fame. To a cruel war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows bound
with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing
he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And the gaining of that early renown is most graphically
drawn by Cominius, the consul (act ii. sc. 2, l. 84),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“At sixteen years,</div>

      <div class='line'>And, in the brunt of seventeen battles since,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The successful general is expected in Rome, and this dialogue
is held between Menenius, Virgilia, and Volumnia (act ii. sc. 1,

for its motto <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Immensi tremor Oceani</em></span>,—“The trembling of the

for its badge the adjoining

<p class='c018'>“This order was instituted by
Louis XI., King of France, in the
year 1469.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c015'><sup>[123]</sup></a> He directed for its
ensign and device a collar of gold,
made with shells laced together
in a double row, held firm upon
little chains or meshes of gold;
in the middle of which collar on
a rock was a gold-image of Saint
Michael, appearing in the front.
And this the king did (with respect
to the Archangel) in imitation
of King Charles VII. his
father; who had formerly borne
that image as his ensign, even at
his entry into Rouen. By reason
always (it is said) of the apparition, on the bridge of Orleans, of Saint Michael
defending the city against the English in a famous attack. This collar then
of the royal order and device of the Knights of the same is the sign or
true ensign of their nobleness, virtue, concord, fidelity and friendship;
Pledge, reward and remuneration of their valour and prowess. By the
richness and purity of the gold are pointed out their high rank and grandeur;
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>by the similarity or likeness of its shells, their equality, or the equal
fraternity of the Order (following the Roman senators, who also bore
shells on their arms for an ensign and a device); by the double lacing
of them together, their invincible and indissoluble union; and by the
image of Saint Michael, victory over the most dangerous enemy. A
device then instituted for the solace, protection and assurance of this so
noble a kingdom; and, on the contrary, for the terror, dread and confusion
of the enemies of the same.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“The order of the Golden
Fleece,” says Paradin, “was instituted
by Philip, Duke of Burgundy,
styled the Good, in the
year 1429, for which he named<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c015'><sup>[124]</sup></a>
twenty-four Knights without reproach,
besides himself, as chief
and founder, and gave to each
one of them for ensign of the
said Order a Collar of gold
composed of his device of the
Fusil, with the Fleece of gold
appearing in front; and this (as
people say) was in imitation of
that which Jason acquired in
Colchis, taken customarily for
Virtue, long so much loved by
this good Duke, that he merited
this surname of Goodness, and
other praises contained on his
Epitaph, where there is mention
made of this Order of the
Fleece, in the person of the

made war on Spain, England, Rome, and Switzerland, and was

<p class='c000'>To the Heraldry of Imaginative Devices might be referred
the greater part of the coats of arms, badges and cognizances by
which noble and gentle families are distinguished. To conclude
this branch of our subject, I will name a woodcut which was
probably peculiar to Geffrey Whitney at the time when Shakespeare
wrote, though accessible to the dramatist from other
sources; it is the fine frontispiece to the <cite>Choice of Emblemes</cite>,
setting forth the heraldic honours and arms of Robert, Earl of
Leycester, and in part of his brother, Ambrose, Earl of Warwick.
Each of these noblemen bore the same crest, and it was, what
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>Shakespeare, <cite>2 Henry VI.</cite> (act v. sc. 1, l. 203, vol. v. p. 215), terms
“the rampant bear chained to the ragged staff.”</p>

<p><span class='small'><cite>Whitney, 1586.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How long this had been the cognizance
of the Earls of Warwick, and
whether it was borne by all the various
families of the Saxon and Norman races
who held the title,—by the Beauchamps,
the Nevilles, and the Dudleys, admits of
doubt; but it is certain that such was the
cognizance in the reign of Henry VI.
and in that of Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to Dugdale’s <cite>Antiquities
of Warwickshire</cite>, edition 1730, p. 398,
the monument of Thomas Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick in Edward III.’s time,
has a lion, not a bear; and a lamb
for his Countess, the Lady Katherine Mortimer. Also on the
monument of another Earl (p. 404), who died in 1401, the bear
does not appear; but on the monument of Richard Beauchamp,
who died “the last day of Aprill, the year of our lord god 1434,”
the inscriptions are crowded with bears, instead of commas and
colons; and the recumbent figure of the Earl has a muzzled
bear at his feet (p. 410). The Nevilles now succeeded to the
title, and a limner’s or designer’s very curious bill, of the fifteenth
year of Henry VI., 1438, shows that the bear and ragged staff
were then both in use and in honour,—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>Among the monuments in the Lady Chapel at Warwick is a
full length figure of “Ambrose Duddeley,” who died in 1589,
and of a muzzled bear crouching at his feet. Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leycester, his brother, died in 1588; and on his magnificent
tomb, in the same chapel, is seen the same cognizance of
the bear and ragged staff. The armorial bearings, however, are
a little different from those which Whitney figures.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, according to the Cambridge edition of Shakespeare’s
works, 1863–1866, vol. v. p. vii., “the play upon which the Second
part of Henry the Sixth was founded was first printed in quarto,
in 1594;” or if, as some with as much reason have supposed,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c015'><sup>[126]</sup></a> it
existed even previous to 1591, it is not likely that these monuments
of elaborate design and costly and skilled workmanship
could have been completed, so that from them Shakespeare had
taken his description of “old Nevil’s crest.” Nathan Drake’s
<cite>Shakspeare and his Times</cite> (vol. i. pp. 410, 416) tells us that he
left Stratford for London “about the year 1586, or 1587;” yet
“the <em>family residence</em> of Shakspeare was <em>always</em> at Stratford:
that he himself originally went <em>alone</em> to London, and that he
spent the greater part of every year there <em>alone</em>, annually,
however, and probably for some months, returning to the
bosom of his family, and that this alternation continued until
he finally left the capital.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, had the monuments in question existed before the
composition of the <cite>Henry VI.</cite>, his annual visits to his native
Warwickshire would have made them known to him, and he
would thus have noted the family cognizance of the brother
Earls; but reason favours the conjecture that these monuments
in the Lady Chapel were not the sources of his knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Common rumour, indeed, may have supplied the information;
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>but as Geffrey Whitney’s book appeared in 1586, its first novelty
would be around it about the time at which Shakespeare was
engaged in producing his <cite>Henry VI.</cite> That Emblem-book was
dedicated to “<span class='sc'>Robert</span> Earle of <span class='sc'>Leycester</span>;” and, as we have
said, contains a drawing, remarkably graphic, of a bear grasping
a ragged staff, having a collar and chain around him, and standing
erect on the helmet’s burgonet. There is also a less elaborate
sketch of the same badge on the title-page to the second
part of Whitney’s <cite>Emblemes</cite>, p. 105.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most exactly, most artistically, does the dramatist ascribe
the same crest, in the same attitude, and in the same standing
place, to Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick, the king-setter-up and
putter-down of History. In the fields between Dartford and
Blackheath, in Kent, the two armies of Lancaster and York are
encamped; in the Dialogue, there is almost a direct challenge
from Lord Clifford to Warwick to meet upon the battle-field.
York is charged as a traitor by Clifford (<cite>2 Henry VI.</cite>, act v.
sc. 1, l. 143, vol. v. p. 213), but replies,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,</div>

<p class='c000'>By Euclid’s axiom, “magnitudes which coincide are equal;”
and though the reasonings in geometry and those in heraldry
are by no means of forces identical, it may be a just conclusion;
therefore, the coincidences and parallelisms of Shakespeare, with
respect to Heraldic Emblems, have their original lines and sources
in such writers as Giovio, Paradin, and Whitney. It was not he
who set up the ancient fortifications, but he has drawn circumvallations
around them, and his towers nod over against theirs,
though with no hostile rivalry.</p>

ECHO has not more voices than Mythology has
transmutations, eccentricities, and cunningly devised
fancies,—and every one of them has its tale
or its narrative—its poetic tissues woven of such
an exquisite thinness that they leave no shadows where they
pass. The mythologies of Egypt and of Greece, of Etruria and
of Rome, in all their varying phases of absolute fiction and
substantial truth, perverted by an unguarded imagination, were
the richest mines that the Emblem writers attempted to work;
they delighted in the freedom with which the fancy seemed
invited to rove from gem to gem, and luxuriated in the many
forms into which their fables might diverge. Now they touched
upon Jove’s thunder, or on the laurel for poets’ brows, which the
lightning’s flash could not harm—then on the beauty and gracefulness
of Venus, or on the doves that fluttered near her car;—Dian’s
severe strictness supplied them with a theme, or Juno
with her queenly birds; and they did not disdain to tell of
Bacchus and the vine, of Circe, and Ulysses, and the Sirens.
The slaying of Niobe’s children, Actæon seized by his hounds,
and Prometheus chained to the rock, Arion rescued by the
dolphin, and Thetis at the tomb of Achilles,—these and many
other myths and tales of antiquity grew up in the minds of
Emblematists, self-sown—ornaments, if not utilities.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>Though the great epic poems are inwrought throughout
with the mosaic work of fables that passed for divine, and of
exploits that were almost more than human, Ovid’s <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>,
printed as early as 1471, and of which an early French
edition, in 1484, bears the title <span class="blackletter">La Bible des poetes</span>, may be
regarded as the chief storehouse of mythological adventure and
misadventure. The revival of literature poured forth the work
in various forms and languages. Spain had her translation in
1494, and Italy in 1497; and as Brunet informs us (vol. iv.
c. 277), to another of Ovid’s books, printed in Piedmont before
1473, there was this singularly incongruous subscription, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>Laus
Deo et Virgini Mariæ Gloriosissimæ Johannes Glim</em>.”</span> Caxton,
in England, led the way by printing Ovid’s <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> in
1480, which Arthur Golding may be said to have completed in
1567 by his <cite>English Metrical Version</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus everywhere was the storehouse of mythology open;
and of the Roman fabulist the Emblem writers, as far as they
could, made a Book of Emblems, and often into their own works
transported freely what they had found in his.</p>

<p class='c000'>And for a poet of no great depth of pure learning, but of
unsurpassed natural power and genius, like Shakespeare, no
class of books would attract his attention and furnish him with
ideas and suggestions so readily as the Emblem writers of the
Latin and Teutonic races. “The eye,” which he describes, “in
a fine phrensy rolling,” would suffice to take in at a single glance
many of the pictorial illustrations which others of duller sensibilities
would only master by laborious study; and though
undoubtedly, from the accuracy with which Shakespeare has
depicted ancient ideas and characters, and shown his familiarity
with ancient customs, usages, and events, he must have read
much and thought much, or else have thought intuitively, it is a
most reasonable conjecture that the popular literature of his
times—the illustrated Emblem-books, which made their way of
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>welcome among the chief nations of middle, western, and
southern Europe—should have been one of the fountains at
which he gained knowledge. Nature, indeed, forms the poet,
and his storehouses of materials on which to work are the inner
and outer worlds, first of his own consciousness, and next of
heaven and earth spread before him. But as a portion of this
latter world we may name the appliances and results of artistic
skill in its delineations of outward forms, and in the fixedness
which it gives to many of the conceptions of the mind. To the
artist himself, and to the poet not less than to the artist, the pictured
shapes and groupings of mythological or fabulous beings
are most suggestive, both of thoughts already embodied there, and
also of other thoughts to be afterwards combined and expressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hence would the Emblem-books, on some of which the foremost
painters and engravers had not disdained to bestow their
powers, become to poets especially fruitful in instruction. A
proverb, a fable, an old world deity is set forth by the pencil
and the graving tool, and the combination supplies additional
elements of reflection. Thus, doubtless, did Shakespeare use such
works; and not merely are some of his thoughts and expressions
in unison with them, but moulded and modified by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>For much indeed of his mythological lore he was indebted to
Ovid’s <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, or, rather, I should say, to “<cite>Ovid’s Metamorphoses</cite>
translated out of Latin in English metre by Arthur
Golding, gent. A worke very pleasaunt and delectable; 4to
London 1565.” That he did attend to Golding’s couplet,—</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet from the Emblem writers as well he appears to have
derived many of his mythological allusions and expressions; we
may trace this generally, and with respect to some of the
Heathen Divinities,—to several of the ancient Heroes and
Heroines, we may note that they supply him with most beautiful
personifications.</p>

<p class='c000'>Generally, as in <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> (act ii. sc. 3, l. 240), the
expression “bull-bearing Milo” finds its device in the <cite>Emblemata</cite>
of Lebeus Batillius, edition Francfort, 1596, where we are
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>told that “Milo by long custom in carrying the calf could also
carry it when it had grown to be a bull.” In <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>
(act ii. sc. 5, l. 8) the lines,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love</div>
      <div class='line'>And therefore hath the wind swift Cupid wings.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We have the scene pictured in Corrozet’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Hecatomgraphie</cite></span>, Paris,
1540, leaf 70, with, however, a very grand profession of regard
for the public good,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Richard II.</cite>(act iii. sc. 2, l. 24) Shakespeare seems to have in
view the act of Cadmus, when he sowed the serpent’s teeth,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This earth shall have a feeling and these stones</div>
      <div class='line'>Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall falter under foul rebellion’s arms.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And the device which emblematizes the fact occurs in Symeoni’s
abbreviation of the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> into the form of
Italian Epigrams (edition Lyons, 1559, device 41, p. 52).</p>

<p class='c000'>And lastly, in <cite>3 Henry VI.</cite> (act v. sc. 1, l. 34), from a few
lines of dialogue between Warwick and King Edward, we
read,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>War.</em> ’Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'><em>K. Edw.</em> Why then ’tis mine, if but by Warwick’s gift.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'><em>War.</em> Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;</div>
      <div class='line'>And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But a better comment cannot be than is found in Giovio’s
“<span class='sc'>Dialogve</span>,” edition Lyons, 1561, p. 129, with Atlas carrying
the Globe of the Heavens, and with the motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Svstinet
nec fatiscit</span>,”</span>—<em>He bears nor grows weary</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of Jupiter and Io is presented in the Emblem-books
by Symeoni, 1561, and by the Plantinian edition of
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>Ovid’s <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, Antwerp, 1591, p. 35. From the latter,
were it needed, we could easily have added a pictorial illustration
to the <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite> (Induction, sc. 2, l. 52),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We'll show thee Io as she was a maid</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Antony and Cleopatra</cite> (act ii. sc. 7, l. 101, vol. ix. p. 60),
in one part, presents the banquet, or, rather, the drinking bout,

of the world.” Enobarbus addresses Antony,—</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, Shakespeare’s allusions to Circe are only two. The
<em>first</em>, in the <cite>Comedy of Errors</cite> (act v. sc. 1, l. 269, vol. i. p. 455),
when all appears in inextricable confusion, and Antipholus of
Ephesus demands justice because of his supposed wrongs. The
Duke Solinus in his perplexity says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why what an intricate impeach is this!</div>
      <div class='line'>I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The <em>second</em>, in <cite>1 Henry VI.</cite> (act v. sc. 3, l. 30, vol. v. p. 86). On
fighting hand to hand with the Maid of Orleans, and taking her
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>prisoner, the Duke of York, almost like a dastard, reproaches
and exults over her noble nature,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Damsel of France I think, I have you fast:</div>

<p class='c000'>So closely connected with Circe are the Sirens of fable that
it is almost impossible to treat of them separately. As usual,
Alciat’s is the Emblem-book (edition 1551) from which we
obtain the illustrative print and the Latin stanzas.</p>

we produce it for what it is worth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Personifications, or, rather, deifications of the powers and
properties of the natural world, and of the influences which
presided over them, belong especially to the ancient Mythology.
Of these, there is one from the Emblem writers decidedly
claiming our notice, I may say, our admiration, because of its
essential truth and beauty;—it is the Personification of Fortune,
or, as some writers name the goddess, Occasion and Opportunity;
and it is highly poetical in all its attributes.</p>

<p class='c000'>From at least four distinct sources in the Emblem-books of
the sixteenth century, Shakespeare might have derived the characteristics
of the goddess; from Alciat, Perriere, Corrozet, and
Whitney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perriere’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Theatre des Bons Engins</span>,”</span> Paris, 1539, presents

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>These French verses may be accepted as a translation of
the Latin of Alciat, on the goddess Opportunity; as may
be seen, she is portrayed standing on a wheel that is floating
upon the waves; and as the tide rises, there are apparently
ships or boats making for the shore. The figure holds a
razor in the right hand, has wings upon the feet, and
abundance of hair streaming from the forehead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The correspondent part to the thought contained in these
three writers occurs in the <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> (act iv. sc. 3, l. 213,
vol. vii. p. 396), where Brutus and Cassius are discussing the
question of proceeding to Philippi and offering battle to “young
Octavius and Marc Antony;” it is decided by the argument
which Brutus urges with much force,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:</div>
      <div class='line'>The enemy increaseth every day;</div>
      <div class='line'>We, at the height, are ready to decline.</div>
      <div class='line'>There is a tide in the affairs of men</div>
      <div class='line'>Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;</div>
      <div class='line'>Omitted, all the voyage of their life</div>

      <div class='line'>On such a full sea are we now afloat,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we must take the current when it serves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or lose our ventures.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These lines, we may observe, are an exact comment on
Whitney’s text; there is the “full sea,” on which Fortune is
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>“now afloat;” and people are all warned, “at the first occasion
to embrace,” or “take the current when it serves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The “images,” too, of Fortune and of Occasion in Corrozet’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Hecatomgraphie</span>,”</span> Embs. 41 and 84, are very suggestive of
the characteristics of the “fickle goddess.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Fortune is standing upright upon the sea; one foot is
on a fish, the other on a globe; and in the right hand is a
broken mast. Occasion is in a boat and standing on a wheel;
she has wings to her feet, and with her hands she holds out
a swelling sail; she has streaming hair, and behind her
in the stern of the boat Penitence is seated, lamenting for
opportunities lost. The stanzas to “Occasion” are very
similar to those of other Emblem writers; and we add, therefore,
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>only the English of the verses to “Fortune,”—<cite>The
Image of Fortune</cite>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A strange event our Fortune is,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Unlocked for, sudden as a shower;</div>
      <div class='line'>Never then, worldling! give to her</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Right over thee to wield her power.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A series of questions follow,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell me, O fortune, for what end thou art holding the broken mast
wherewith thou supportest thyself? And why also is it that thou art painted
upon the sea, encircled with so long a veil? Tell me too why under thy feet
are the ball and the dolphin?”</p>

<p class='c000'>As in the answers given by Whitney, there is abundant plainness
in Corrozet,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is to show my instability, and that in me there is no security. Thou
seest this mast broken all across,—this veil also puffed out by various winds,-beneath
one foot, the dolphin amid the waves; below the other foot, the
round unstable ball;—I am thus on the sea at a venture. He who has made
my portraiture wishes no other thing to be understood than this, that distrust
is enclosed beneath me and that I am uncertain of reaching a safe haven;—near
am I to danger, from safety ever distant: in perplexity whether to weep
or to laugh,—doubtful of good or of evil, as the ship which is upon the seas
tossed by the waves, is doubtful in itself where it will be borne. This then is
what you see in my true image, hither and thither turned without security.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A description, very similar to this, occurs in the dialogue
between Fluellen, a Welsh captain, and “an aunchient
lieutenant” Pistol (<cite>Henry V.</cite>, act iii. sc. 6, 1. 20, vol. iv.
P. 543),—</p>

<p class='c026'><em>Flu.</em> By your patience, Aunchient Pistol, Fortune is painted blind, with a
muffler afore her eyes, to signify to you that fortune is blind; and she is
painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that

look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and rolls:
in good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description of it: Fortune
is an excellent moral.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortune on the sphere, or “rolling, restless stone,” is also well
pictured in the “ΜΙΚΡΟΚΟΣΜΟΣ,” editions 1579 and 1584. The
whole device is described in the French version,—</p>

<p class='c000'>The ideas of the Emblematists respecting the goddess
“<span class='sc'>Occasion</span>” are also embodied by Shakespeare two or three
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>times. Thus on receiving the evil tidings of his mother’s death
and of the dauphin’s invasion, King John (act iv. sc. 2, l. 125,

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>2 Henry IV.</cite> (act iv. sc. 1, l. 70, vol. iv. p. 431) the Archbishop

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Very appropriately in illustration of these and other passages
in Shakespeare may we refer to John David’s work, “<span class='sc'>Occasio
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>arrepta neglecta</span>” (4to, Antwerp, 1605),—<em>Opportunity seized
or neglected</em>. It contains twelve curiously beautiful plates by
Theodore Galle, showing the advantages of seizing the Occasion,
the disadvantages of neglecting it. We choose an example, it is
Schema 7, cap. 1, p. 117. (See <a href='#plate12'>Plate XII</a>.)</p>

<p class='c018'>“While Time is passing onward men keep Occasion back by seizing the
hair on her forehead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Various speakers are introduced,—</p>

      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Time.</em> Now the need is to visit other climes of earth</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The line, “her scattered locks in front seize hold of,” has its
parallel in <cite>Othello</cite> (act iii. sc. 1, l. 47, vol. viii. p. 505),—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Classical celebrities, whether hero or heroine, wrapt round
with mystery, or half-developed into historical reality, may also
form portion of our Mythological Series.</p>

<p class='c000'>The grand character in Æschylus, <cite>Prometheus Bound</cite>, is
depicted by at least four of the Emblematists. The hero of
suffering is reclining against the rock on Caucasus, to which he
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>had been chained; a vulture is seated on his broad chest and
feeding there. Alciat’s Emblem, from the Lyons edition of 1551,
or Antwerp, 1581, number 102, has the motto which reproves
men for seeking the knowledge which is beyond them: <em>Things
which are above us, are nothing to us</em>,—they are not our concern.
The whole fable is a warning.</p>

in French stanzas Prometheus and his cruel destiny; a fine

Caucasus, but to the cross.</p>

and Whitney’s (p. 75), adopt the same motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>O vita misero
longa</em></span>,—“O life, how long for the wretched.” The stanzas of
the latter may be accepted as being in some degree representative
of those of the former,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To Caucasus, behoulde <span class='sc'>Promethevs</span> chain’de,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Although wee liue, yet still wee dyinge are.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How Shakespeare applies this mythic story appears in the
<cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> (act ii. sc. 1, l. 14, vol. vi. p. 451), where Aaron,
speaking of his queen, Tamora, affirms of himself,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“Whom thou in triumph long</div>

      <div class='line'>And faster bound to Aaron’s charming eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And still more clearly is the application made, <cite>1 Henry VI.</cite> (act
iv. sc. 3, l. 17, vol. v. p. 71), when Sir William Lucy thus urges
York,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thou princely leader of our English strength,</div>

      <div class='line'>Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who now is girdled with a waist of iron</div>
      <div class='line'>And hemm’d about with grim destruction:”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>and at York’s inability, through “the vile traitor Somerset,” to
render aid, Lucy laments (l. 47, p. 72),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thus, while the vulture of sedition</div>
      <div class='line'>Feeds in the bosoms of such great commanders,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss</div>
      <div class='line'>The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,</div>
      <div class='line'>That ever living man of memory,</div>
      <div class='line'>Henry the Fifth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It may readily be supposed that in writing these passages
Shakespeare had in memory, or even before him, the delineations
which are given of Prometheus, for the vulture feeding on
the heart belongs to them all, and the allusion is exactly one of
those which arises from a casual glance at a scene or picture
without dwelling on details.</p>

<p class='c007'>This casual glance indeed seems to have been the way
in which our Dramatist appropriated others of the Emblem
sketches. In the well-known quarrel scene between Brutus and
Cassius, in <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> (act iv. sc. 3, l. 21, vol. vii. p. 389),
Brutus demands,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“What, shall one of us,</div>
      <div class='line'>That struck the foremost man of all this world</div>
      <div class='line'>But for supporting robbers, shall we now</div>
      <div class='line'>Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sell the mighty space of our large honours</div>
      <div class='line'>For so much trash as may be grasped thus?</div>
      <div class='line'>I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than such a Roman.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The expression is the perfect counterpart of Alciat’s
164th Emblem (p. 571, edition Antwerp, 1581); the motto,
copied by Whitney (p. 213), is, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Inanis impetus</em></span>,—“A vain
attack.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“By night, as at a mirror, the dog looks at the lunar orb:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And seeing himself, believes another dog to be on high,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The device engraved on Alciat’s and Whitney’s pages depicts
the full moon surrounded by stars, and a large dog baying.
Whitney’s stanzas give the meaning of Alciat's, and also of
Beza's, which follow below,—</p>

<p class='c000'>In a similar strain, from the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> (act v. sc. 1,

music possesses over—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in23'>“a wild and wanton herd</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The poet declares,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or any air of music touch their ears,</div>
      <div class='line'>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their savage eyes turn’d to a modest gaze</div>
      <div class='line'>By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c015'><sup>[134]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;</div>
      <div class='line'>Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,</div>
      <div class='line'>But music for the time doth change his nature.</div>
      <div class='line'>The man that hath no music in himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>And in the <cite>Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite> (act iii. sc. 2, l. 68, vol.
i. p. 129), the method is developed by which Silvia, through the
conversation of Proteus, may be tempered “to hate young
Valentine” and Thurio love. Proteus says,—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You must lay lime to tangle her desires</div>

      <div class='line in2'><em>Duke.</em> Ay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Pro.</em> Say that upon the altar of her beauty</div>
      <div class='line'>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Again, in proof of Music’s power, consult <cite>Henry VIII.</cite> (act iii.
sc. 1, l. 1, vol. vi. p. 56), when Queen Katharine, in her sorrowfulness,
says to one of her women who were at work around her,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sing and disperse ’em if thou canst: leave working.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The sweet simple song is raised,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Orpheus with his lute made trees</div>
      <div class='line'>And the mountain tops that freeze,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Bow themselves when he did sing:</div>
      <div class='line'>To his music plants and flowers</div>
      <div class='line'>Ever sprung, as sun and showers</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There had made a lasting spring.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Everything that heard him play,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even the billows of the sea,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hung their heads, and then lay by.</div>
      <div class='line'>In sweet music is such art,</div>
      <div class='line'>Killing care and grief of heart</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Fall asleep, or hearing die.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How splendidly does the dramatic poet’s genius here shine
forth! It pours light upon each Emblem, and calls into day
the hidden glories. His spirit breathes upon a dead picture,
and rivalling Orpheus himself, he makes the images breathe and
glance and live.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mythic tale of Actæon transformed into a stag, and
hunted by hounds because of his rudeness to Diana and her
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>nymphs, was used to point the moral of widely different subjects.
Alciatus (Emb. 52, ed. 1551, p. 60) applies it “<em>to the harbourers
of assassins</em>” and makes it the occasion of a very true but very
severe reflection.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The device is graphically drawn: Actæon is in part embruted;
he is fleeing with the dogs close upon him. Supposing
Shakespeare to have seen this print, it represents
to the life Pistol’s words in the <cite>Merry Wives of Windsor</cite>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Ex domino servus</span>,”</span>—<em>The slave out of the master</em>,—is
another saying which the tale of Actæon has illustrated.
The application is from Aneau’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Picta Poesis</span>,”</span> fol. 41.
On the left hand of the tiny drawing are Diana and her
nymphs, busied in the bath, beneath the shelter of an
overhanging cliff,—on the right is Actæon, motionless, with
a stag’s head; dogs are around him. The verses translated
read thus,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Horns being bestowed upon Actæon when changed to a stag,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>A ready prepared prey he is for his fawning dogs!</div>

<p class='c000'>But Sambucus in his <cite>Emblems</cite> (edition 1564, p. 128), and
Whitney after him (p. 15)—making use of the same woodcut,
only with a different border—adapt the Actæon-tragedy to
another subject and moral, and take the words, <em>Pleasure
purchased by anguish</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanzas which may thus be rendered,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whoever too eagerly hunting pursues, and without moderation</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Drains paternal treasures and lavishes them on dogs:</div>
      <div class='line'>So great the love of the folly, so strong does the passion return</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That it clothes him in the twin horns of the swift stag.</div>
      <div class='line'>It happened, Actæon, to thee, who though horned from thy birth,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>By thy own dogs into pieces wast torn.</div>
      <div class='line'>At this day how many, whom the dogs’ quick scent delights,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The strong passion for hunting wastes and devours.</div>
      <div class='line'>Put not off serious things for sports,—advantages for losses:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As one in need so hold fast whatever things remain:</div>
      <div class='line'>Often even the horn bearer, his own wife forsaken,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Loves desperately strangers, and pays penalties for crimes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>We here see that Sambucus has adopted the theory of
the old grammarian or historian of Alexandria, Palæphatus,
who informs us,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Actæon by race was an Arcadian, very fond of dogs. Many of them he
kept, and hunted in the mountains. But he neglected his own affairs, for
men then were all self-workers; they had no servants, but themselves tilled
the earth; and that man was the richest, who tilled the earth and was the
most diligent workman. But Actæon being careless of domestic affairs,
and rather going about hunting with his dogs, his substance was wasted.
And when he had nothing left, people kept saying: the wretched Actæon
was eaten up by his own dogs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A very instructive tale this for some of our Nimrods, mighty
hunters and racers in the land; but it is not to be pressed too
strictly into the service of the parsimonious.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the same motto Whitney (p. 15) keeps much closer to
the mythological narrative,<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c015'><sup>[136]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The full force and meaning of the mythological tale is,
however, brought out in the <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> (act ii. sc. 3,
l. 55, vol. vi. p. 459), that fearful history of passion and
revenge. Tamora is in the forest, and Bassianus and Lavinia
make their appearance,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Bass.</em> Who have we here? Rome’s royal empress,</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Arion rescued by the Dolphin is another mythic tale in which
poets may well delight. Alciatus (Emblem 89, edition 1581),
directs the moral, “<em>against the avaricious, or those to whom a
better condition is offered by strangers</em>.” Contrary to the French
writers of time and place, the emblem presents in the same

<p class='c000'>A comment from St. Chrysostom, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>super Matth.</em></span> xxii., is
added,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“As a king is honoured in his image, so God is loved and hated in
man. He cannot hate man, who loves God, nor can he, who hates God,
love men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Reference is also made to Aulus Gellius (bk. v. c. 14, vol. i.
p. 408), where the delightful story is narrated of the slave
Androclus and the huge lion whose wounded foot he had cured,
and with whom he lived familiarly for three years in the same
cave and on the same food. After a time the slave was taken
and condemned to furnish sport in the circus to the degraded
Romans. That same lion also had been taken, a beast of vast
size, and power and fierceness. The two were confronted in
the arena.</p>

<p class='c018'>“When the lion saw the man at a distance,” says the narrator, “suddenly,
as if wondering, he stood still; and then gently and placidly as if recognising
drew near. With the manner and observance of fawning dogs, softly and
blandly he wagged his tail and placed himself close to the man’s body, and
lightly with his tongue licked the legs and hands of the slave almost
lifeless from fear. The man Androclus during these blandishments of the
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>fierce wild creature recovered his lost spirits; by degrees he directed his
eyes to behold the lion. Then, as if mutual recognition had been made, man
and lion appeared glad and rejoicing one with the other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Was it now, from having this tale in mind that, in the
<cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> (act v. sc. 3, l. 37, vol. vi. p. 247), these

<p class='c000'>To the Emblems we have under consideration we meet with

<p class='c000'>As examples of a sentiment directly opposite, we will briefly
refer to Coustau’s <cite>Pegma</cite> (p. 323, edition Lyons, 1555), where
to the device of a Camel and his driver, the noble motto is
recorded and exemplified from Plutarch, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Homo homini Deus</em></span>,—“Man
is a God to man;” the reason being assigned,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“As the world was created for sake of gods and men, so man was created
for man’s sake;” and, “that the grace we receive from the immortal God is
to be bestowed on man by man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Reusner, too, in his <cite>Emblemata</cite> (p. 142, Francfort, 1581),

<p class='c000'>Was it in reference to these sentiments that Hamlet and

<p class='c018'>“What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in

<p class='c000'>So in the <cite>Pericles</cite> (act iii. sc. 2, l. 26, vol. ix. p. 366), the fine

      <div class='line in23'>“I hold it ever,</div>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c000'>The horses and chariot of Phœbus, and the presumptuous
charioteer Phaëton, who attempted to drive them, are celebrated
with great splendour of description in Ovid’s <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>
(bk. ii. fab. 1), that rich storehouse of Mythology. The palace
of the god has lofty columns bright with glittering gold; the
roof is covered with pure shining ivory; and the double gates
are of silver. Here Phœbus was throned, and clothed in
purple;—the days and months and years,—the seasons and the
ages were seated around him; Phaëton appears, claims to be
his son, and demands for one day to guide the glorious steeds.
At this point we take up the narrative which Alciat has written

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare’s notices of the attempted feat and its failure
are frequent. First, in the <cite>Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite> (act iii.

letter addressed to his daughter Silvia, with the promise,—</p>

      <div class='line'>“Silvia, this night will I enfranchise thee,”—</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why, Phaethon,—for thou art Merops’ son,—</div>

<p class='c000'>In her impatience for the meeting with Romeo (<cite>Romeo and

<p class='c000'>In the early heroic age, when Minos reigned in Crete and
Theseus at Athens, just as Mythology was ripening into history,
the most celebrated for mechanical contrivance and for excellence
in the arts of sculpture and architecture were Dædalus
and his sons Talus and Icarus. To them is attributed the
invention of the saw, the axe, the plumb-line, the auger, the
gimlet, and glue; they contrived masts and sailyards for ships;
and they discovered various methods of giving to statues
expression and the appearance of life. Chiefly, however, are
Dædalus and Icarus now known for fitting wings to the human
arms, and for attempting to fly across the sea from Crete to the
shore of Greece. Dædalus, hovering just above the waves,
accomplished the aërial voyage in safety; but Icarus, too
ambitiously soaring aloft, had his wings injured by the heat of
the sun, and fell into the waters, which from his death there were
named the Icarian sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tearful tale of Niobe, who that has read Ovid’s <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>
(bk. vi. fab. 5) could not weep over it! Seven
stalwart sons and seven fair daughters clustered round the
haughty dame, and she gloried in their attendance upon her;
but at an evil hour she dared to match herself with Latona, and
at a public festival in honour of the goddess to be the only one
refusing to offer incense and prayers. The goddess called her
own children to avenge the affront and the impiety; and Apollo
and Diana, from the clouds, slew the seven sons as they were
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>exercising on the plain near Thebes. Yet the pride of Niobe
did not abate, and Diana in like manner slew also the seven
daughters. The mother’s heart was utterly broken; she wept
herself to death, and was changed to stone. Yet, says the poet,

<p class='c000'>Hamlet, too (act i. sc. 2, l. 147, vol. viii. p. 17), in his bitter

<p class='c000'>Tiresias, the blind soothsayer of Thebes, had foretold that
the comely Narcissus would live as long as he could refrain from
the sight of his own countenance,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“But he, ignorant of his destiny,” says Claude Mignault, “grew so
desperately in love with his own image seen in a fountain, that he miserably
wasted away, and was changed into the flower of his own name, which is
called <em>Narce</em>, and means drowsiness or infatuation, because the smell of the
Narcissus affects the head.”</p>

<p class='c000'>However that may be, Alciatus, edition Antwerp, 1581,
exhibits the youth surveying his features in a running stream;
the flower is behind him, and in the distance is Tiresias
pronouncing his doom. “Self love” is the motto.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> (act ii. sc. 1, l. 227, vol. ii.

<p class='c000'>The famous winged horse, Pegasus, heroic, though not a
hero, has a right to close in our array of mythic characters.
Sprung from the blood of Medusa when Perseus cut off her
head, Pegasus is regarded sometimes as the thundering steed of
Jove, at other times as the war-horse of Bellerophon; and in
more modern times, under a third aspect, as the horse of the
Muses. Already (at p. 142) we have spoken of some of the
merits attributed to him, and have presented Emblems in which
he is introduced. It will be sufficient now to bring forward the
device and stanza of Alciat, in which he shows us how “by
prudence and valour to overcome the Chimæra, that is, the
stronger and those using stratagems.”

his classically mythic tales he was indeed indebted to the Emblematists;
yet the many parallels in mythology between him
and them justify the pleasant labour of setting both side by

</div><p class='drop-capi1_0'>
SIMILITUDES and, in cases not a few, identities
have often been detected between the popular
tales of widely distant nations, intimating either
a common origin, or a common inventive power
to work out like results. Fables have ever been a floating
literature,—borne hither and thither on the current of Time,—used
by any one, and properly belonging to no one. How
they have circulated from land to land, and from age to age,
we cannot tell; whence they first arose it is impossible to
divine. There exist, we are told, fables collected by Bidpai in
Sanscrit, by Lokman in Arabic, by Æsop in Greek, and by
Phædrus in Latin; and they seem to have been interchanged
and borrowed one from the other as if they were the property
of the world,—handed down from the ancestorial times of a
remote antiquity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare’s general estimation of fables, and of those of
Æsop in particular, may be gathered from certain expressions in
two of the plays,—in the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> (act v. sc. 1,
l. 1, vol. ii. p. 258) and in <cite>3 Henry VI</cite>. (act v. sc. 5, l. 25, vol. v. p.
329). In the <em>former</em> the speakers are Hippolyta and Theseus,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Hip.</em> ’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.</div>
      <div class='line in3'><em>The.</em> More strange than true: I never may believe</div>
      <div class='line'>These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend</div>
      <div class='line'>More than cool reason ever comprehends.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the <em>latter</em> Queen Margaret’s son in reproof of Gloucester,
declares,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let Æsop fable in a winter’s night;</div>
      <div class='line'>His currish riddles sort not with this place.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The year of Shakespeare’s birth, 1564, saw the publication,
at Rome, of the Latin Fables of Gabriel Faerni; they had been
written at the request of Pope Pius IV., and possess a high
degree of excellence, both for their correct Latinity and for the
power of invention which they display. Roscoe, in his <cite>Life of
Leo X.</cite> (Bohn’s ed. ii. p. 172), even avers that they “are written
with such classical purity, as to have given rise to an opinion
that he had discovered and fraudulently availed himself of some
of the unpublished works of Phædrus.” This opinion, however,
is without any foundation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Dialogues of Creatures moralised</cite> preceded, however, the
<cite>Fables</cite> of Faerni by above eighty years. “In the Latin and
Dutch only there were not less than fifteen known editions
before 1511.”<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c015'><sup>[142]</sup></a> An edition in Dutch is named as early as 1480,
and one in French in 1482; and the English version appeared,
it is likely, at nearly as early a date. These and other books of
fables, though by a contested claim, are often regarded as books
of Emblems. The best Emblem writers, even the purest,
introduce fables and little tales of various kinds; as <cite>Alciat</cite>,
Emb. 7, The Image of Isis, the Ass and the Driver; Emb. 15,
The Cock, the Lion, and the Church; Emb. 59, The Blackamoor
washed White, &amp;c.: <cite>Hadrian Junius</cite>, Emb. 4, The caged
Cat and the Rats; Emb. 19, The Crocodile and her Eggs:
<cite>Perriere</cite>, Emb. 101, Diligence, Idleness, and the Ants. They all,
in fact, adopted without scruple the illustrations which suited
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>their particular purpose; and Whitney, in one part of his
<cite>Emblemes</cite>, uses twelve of Faerni’s fables in succession.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the fables to which Shakespeare alludes some have been
quoted in the former part of this work;—as The Fly and the
Candle; The Sun, the Wind, and the Traveller; The Elephant
and the undermined Tree; The Countryman and the Serpent.
Of others we now proceed to give examples.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hares biting the dead Lion had, perhaps, one of its
earliest applications, if not its origin, in the conduct of Achilles
and his coward Greeks to the dead body of Hector, which
Homer thus records (<cite>Iliad</cite>, xxii. 37),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“The other sons of the Greeks crowded around;</div>
      <div class='line'>And admired Hector’s stature and splendid form;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor was there one standing by who did not inflict a wound.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Claude Mignault, in his notes to Alciatus (Emb. 153), quotes
an epigram, from an unknown Greek author, which Hector is
supposed to have uttered as he was dragged by the Grecian
chariot,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now after my death ye pierce my body;</div>
      <div class='line'>The very hares are bold to insult a dead lion.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> (act v. sc. 8, l. 21, vol. vi. p. 259)
exhibits the big, brutal Achilles exulting over his slain enemy,
and giving the infamous order,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come, tie his body to my horse’s tail;</div>
      <div class='line'>Along the field I will the Trojan trail.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And afterwards (act v. sc. 10, l. 4, vol. vi. p. 260) the atrocities
are recounted to which Hector’s body was exposed,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He’s dead, and at the murderer’s horse’s tail</div>
      <div class='line'>In beastly sort dragg’d through the shameful field.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The description thus given accords with that of Alciatus,
Reusner, and Whitney, in reference to the saying, “We must
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>not struggle with phantoms.”  Alciat’s stanzas (Emb. 153)
are,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Friendship enduring even after death</em>,” might receive a
variety of illustrations. The conjugal relation of life frequently
exemplifies its truth; and occasionally there are friends who
show still more strongly how death hallows the memory of the
departed, and makes survivors all the more faithful in their love.
As the emblem of such fidelity and affection Alciat (Emb. 159)
selects the figures of the elm and the vine.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c015'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Whitney takes possession of Faerni’s fable, and gives the

one,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Foxe, that longe for grapes did leape in vayne,</div>
      <div class='line'>With wearie limmes, at lengthe did sad departe:</div>
      <div class='line'>And to him selfe quoth hee, I doe disdayne</div>
      <div class='line'>These grapes I see, bicause their taste is tarte:</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Still makes thy boast, thou maist if that thou list.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Plantin, the famed printer of Antwerp, had, in 1583, put
forth an edition of Faerni’s fables,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c015'><sup>[144]</sup></a> and thus undoubtedly it
was that Whitney became acquainted with them; and from the
intercourse then existing between Antwerp and London it
would be strange if a copy had not fallen into Shakespeare’s
hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Owing to some malady, the King of France, in <cite>All’s Well
that Ends Well</cite> (act ii. sc. 1, l. 59, vol. iii. p. 133), is unable to go

“the sons of worthy Frenchmen.” Lafeu, an old lord, has
learned from Helena some method of cure, and brings the
tidings to the king, and kneeling before him is bidden to
rise,—</p>

<p class='c000'>The fox, indeed, has always been a popular animal, and is
the subject of many fables which are glanced at by Shakespeare;—as
in the <cite>Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite> (act iv. sc. 4, l. 87,

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>“Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertained</div>
      <div class='line'>A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.”</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Or in <cite>2 Henry VI.</cite> (act iii. sc. 1, l. 55, vol. v. p. 153), where
Suffolk warns the king of “the bedlam brain-sick duchess” of
Gloucester,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And again, in <cite>3 Henry VI.</cite> (act iv. sc. 7, l. 24, vol. v. p. 312), the
cunning creature is praised by Gloucester in an “<em>aside</em>,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>“But when the fox hath once got in his nose,</div>

<p class='c000'>The bird in borrowed plumes, or the Jackdaw dressed out in

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>It is in the <em>Third</em> Century of the Symbols and Emblems of

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare was familiar with the fable. In <cite>2 Henry VI.</cite>

      <div class='line'>“Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent</div>

  </div>

<p class='c000'>But Margaret, his strong-willed queen, remarks (l. 75),—</p>

      <div class='line'>For he’s inclined as is the ravenous wolf.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> (act i. sc. 1, l. 68, vol. vii. p. 322), Flavius,

      <div class='line'>“These growing feathers pluck’d from Cæsar’s wing</div>

      <div class='line'>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But more forcibly is the spirit of the fable expressed,
when of Timon of Athens (act ii. sc. 1, l. 28, vol. vii. p. 228)
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>a Senator, who was one of his importunate creditors, declares,—</p>

<p class='c000'>Whitney adopts the same motto (p. 220), “He conquers who
endures;” but while retaining from Junius the ash-tree in the
pictorial illustration, he introduces into his stanzas “the mightie
oke,” instead of the “stout ash.” From Erasmus (<em>in Epist.</em>) he
introduces an excellent quotation, that “it is truly the mark of
a great mind to pass over some injuries, nor to have either ears
or tongue ready for certain revilings.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>In several instances it is difficult to determine whether
expressions which have the appearance of glancing at fables
really do refer to them, or whether they are current sayings,
passing to and fro without any defined ownership. Also it is
difficult to make an exact classification of what belongs to the
fabulous and what to the proverbial. Of both we might collect
many more examples than those which we bring forward; but
the limits of our subject remind us that we must, as a general
rule, confine our researches and illustrations to the Emblem
writers themselves. We take this opportunity of saying that we
may have arranged our instances in an order which some may
be disposed to question; but mythology, fable, and proverb
often run one into the other, and the knots cannot easily be
disentangled. Take a sword and cut them; but the sword
though sharp is not convincing.</p>

PROVERBS are nearly always suggestive of a
little narrative, or of a picture, by which the
sentiment might be more fully developed. The
brief moral reflections appended to many fables
partake very much of the nature of proverbs. Inasmuch,
then, as there is this close alliance between them, we might
consider the Proverbial Philosophy of Shakespeare only as a
branch of the Philosophy of Fable; still, as there are in his
dramas many instances of the use of the pure proverb, and
instances too of the same kind in the Emblem writers, we
prefer making a separate Section for the proverbs or wise
sayings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Occasionally, like the Sancho Panza of his renowned contemporary,
Michael de Cervantes Saavedra, 1549–1616,<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c015'><sup>[146]</sup></a> Shakespeare
launches “a leash of proverbial philosophies at once;”
but with this difference, that the dramatist’s application of them
is usually suggestive either of an Emblem-book origin, or of an
Emblem-book destination. The example immediately in view
is from the scene (<cite>3 Henry VI.</cite>, act i. sc. 4, l. 39, vol. v. p. 245)
in which Clifford and Northumberland lay hands of violence on
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>Richard Plantagenet, duke of York; the dialogue proceeds in
the following way, York exclaiming,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Clif.</em> So cowards fight, when they can fly no further.</div>
      <div class='line'>So doves do peck the falcon’s piercing talons.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The queen entreats Clifford, “for a thousand causes,” to withhold
his arm, and Northumberland joins in the entreaty,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>North.</em> Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much,</div>
      <div class='line'>To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:</div>
      <div class='line'>What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,</div>
      <div class='line'>For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he might spurn him with his foot away?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Clifford and Northumberland seize York, who struggles against
them (l. 61),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Clif.</em> Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c015'><sup>[147]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'><em>North.</em> So doth the cony struggle in the net.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>York is taken prisoner, as he says (l. 63),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So triumph thieves upon their conquer’d booty;</div>
      <div class='line'>So true men yield, with robbers so o’ermatch’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The four or five notions or sayings here enunciated a
designer or engraver could easily translate into as many Emblematical
devices, and the mind which uses them, as naturally
as if he had invented them, must surely have had some familiarity
with the kind of writing of which proverbs are the main
source and foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection we will quote the proverb which “Clifford
of Cumberland” (<cite>2 Henry VI.</cite>, act v. sc. 2, l. 28, vol. vi. p. 217)
utters in French at the very moment of death, and which agrees
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>very closely with similar sayings in Emblem-books by French
authors,—Perriere and Corrozet,—and still more in suitableness
to the occasion on which it was spoken, the end of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>York and Clifford,—it is the elder of that name,—engage in
mortal combat (l. 26),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Clif.</em> My soul and body on the action both!</div>
      <div class='line'><em>York.</em> A dreadful lay! address thee instantly.”</div>
      <div class='c017'><span class='small'>[<em>They fight, and</em> <span class='sc'>Clifford</span> <em>falls.</em></span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>At the point of death Clifford uses the words (l. 28), <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>La fin
couronne les œuvres</em></span>.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c015'><sup>[148]</sup></a>—“The end crowns the work.” It was, no
doubt, a common proverb; but it is one which would suggest to the
Emblem writer his artistic illustration, and, with a little change,
from some such illustration it appears to have been borrowed.
Whitney (p. 130) records a resemblance to it among the sayings
of the Seven Sages, dedicated “<em>to Sir</em> <span class='sc'>Hvghe Cholmeley</span>
<em>Knight</em>,”—</p>

<p class='c000'>Corrozet’s descriptive verses conclude with thoughts to which
old Clifford’s dying words might well be appended: “When
the game of life is over,<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c015'><sup>[149]</sup></a> every human body is hidden in
the earth; as well great as little the earth covers; what alone
remains to us is the good deed.” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>La fin couronne les

<p class='c000'>But Shakespeare uses the expression, “the end crowns all,”

<p class='c000'>Near Mortimer’s Cross, in Herefordshire, a messenger relates
how “the noble Duke of York was slain” (<cite>3 Henry VI.</cite>, act ii.
sc. 1, l. 50, vol. v. p. 252), and employs a similar, almost an
identical, proverb,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Environed he was with many foes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And stood against them, as the hope of Troy</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the Greeks that would have enter’d Troy.</div>
      <div class='line'>But Hercules himself must yield to odds;</div>
      <div class='line'>And many strokes, though with a little axe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hew down and fell the hardest-timber’d oak.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This is almost the coincidence of the copyist, and but for the
necessities of the metre, Whitney’s words might have been
literally quoted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Manie droppes pierce the stone,” has its parallel in the
half-bantering, half-serious, conversation between King Edward
and Lady Grey (<cite>3 Henry VI.</cite>, act iii. sc. 2, l. 48, vol. v. p. 280).
The lady prays the restoration of her children’s lands, and the
king intimates he has a boon to ask in return,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>King Edw.</em> Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Grey.</em> Why then I will do what your grace commands.</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Glou.</em> [<em>Aside to</em> <span class='sc'>Clar.</span>] He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Clar.</em> [<em>Aside to</em> <span class='sc'>Glou.</span>] As red as fire! nay, then her wax must melt.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In Otho Vænius (p. 210), where Cupid is bravely working at
felling a tree, to the motto, “By continuance,” we find the
stanza,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>“Not with one stroke at first the great tree goes to grownd,</div>

<p class='c000'>“To clip the anvil of my sword,” is an expression in the
<cite>Coriolanus</cite> (act iv. sc. 5, lines 100–112, vol. vi. p. 380) very difficult
to be explained, unless we regard it as a proverb, denoting
the breaking of the weapon and the laying aside of enmity.
Aufidius makes use of it in his welcome to the banished Coriolanus,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To clip, or cut, <em>i.e.</em>, strike the anvil with a sword, is exhibited
by more than one of the Emblem writers, whose stanzas are
indeed to the same effect as those of Massinger in his play, <cite>The
Duke of Florence</cite> (act ii. sc. 3),—</p>

      <div class='line'>So trust enforced too far proves treachery,</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>But the meaning is, the putting of friendship to too severe a
trial: “As he is in danger of breaking his sword who strikes it
upon an anvil, so is love very soon cut in pieces when foolishly
a man presses upon his friend.” So Whitney (p. 192), to the
motto, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Importunitas euitanda</em></span>,—“Want of consideration to be
avoided,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c000'>Touchstone, the clown, in <cite>As You Like It</cite> (act ii. sc. 4, l. 43,
vol. ii. p. 400), names the various tokens of his affections for
Jane Smile, and declares, “I remember, when I was in love I
broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming
a-night to Jane Smile: and I remember the kissing of her
batlet and the cow’s-dugs that her pretty chopt hands had
milked.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It may, however, from the general inaccuracy of spelling in
the early editions of Shakespeare, be allowed to suppose a
typographical error, and that the phrase in question should
read, not “anvil of my sword,” but “handle;”—I clip, or
embrace the handle, grasp it firmly in token of affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The innocence of broken love-vows is intimated in <cite>Romeo
and Juliet</cite> (act ii. sc. 2, l. 90, vol. vii. p. 42),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>Thou mayst prove false: at lovers’ perjuries,</div>
      <div class='line'>They say, Jove laughs.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And most closely is the sentiment represented in the design by
Otho van Veen (p. 140), of Venus dispensing Cupid from his
oaths, and of Jupiter in the clouds smiling benignantly on the
two. The mottoes are, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Amoris ivsivrandvm pœnam non
habet</span>,”</span>—<em>Love excused from periurie</em>,—and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Giuramento sparso
al vento.”</span></p>

<p class='c000'>In Callimachus occurs Juliet’s very expression, “at lovers’
perjuries Jove laughs,”—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and from Tibullus we learn, that whatever silly love may have
eagerly sworn, Jupiter has forbidden to hold good,—</p>

      <div class='line'>And loue no fault comitts in swearing more than troth.”</div>
    </div>

      <div class='line in2'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>l’Amoroso spergiuro non si cura.</em>”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To such unsound morality, however, Shakespeare offers strong
objections in the Friar’s words (<cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, act iii. sc. 3,
l. 126),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c000'>We have endeavoured to interpret the old French stanza into
English rhyme,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who in love’s tempting sieve shall place his store,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since nothing profits there, will lose the more;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost are his time, goods, rings and rich array,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till grief in bitterness complete his day.</div>
      <div class='line'>Folly of youth and free desire incite</div>
      <div class='line'>Great sums to lavish on each brief delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Surely young men on this ought well to ponder,</div>
      <div class='line'>That better cannot be, if thus they wander;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when remains two apples’ worth alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twill not the time be their mistake to own.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare presents the very same thought and almost the
identical expressions. To the Countess of Rousillon, Bertram’s
mother, Helena confesses love for her son, <cite>All’s Well that Ends
Well</cite> (act i. sc. 3, l. 182, vol. iii. p. 127),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“Then, I confess,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,</div>

      <div class='line'>My friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love:</div>
      <div class='line'>Be not offended; for it hurts not him</div>
      <div class='line'>That he is loved of me: I follow him not</div>
      <div class='line'>By any token of presumptuous suit;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;</div>

      <div class='line'>And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,</div>

      <div class='line'>The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,</div>
      <div class='line'>But knows of him no more.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How probable do the turns of thought, “captious and
intenible sieve,” “the waters of my love,” render the supposition
that Perriere’s Emblem of Love and the Sieve had
been seen by our dramatist. Cupid appears patient and
passive, but the Lover in very evident surprise sees “the rings
and rich <em>array</em>” flow through <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“le crible d’amours.”</span> Cupid’s
eyes, in the device, are bound, and the method of binding them
corresponds with the lines, <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>(act i. sc. 4, l. 4,
vol. vii. p. 23),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Again, though not in reference to the same subject, there is in
<cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite> (act v. sc. 1, l. 1, vol. ii. p. 69), the
comparison of the sieve to labour in vain. Antonio is giving
advice to Leonato when overwhelmed with sorrows,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Ant.</em> If you go on thus you will kill yourself;</div>

      <div class='line in2'><em>Leon.</em> <span style="margin-left: 4em;">I pray thee, cease thy counsel,</span></div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>Both writers make the proverb the groundwork of reflexions
on a human skull. According to Anulus, “the relics of the
charnel house were once the living images of God,”—“that ruin
of a dome was formerly the citadel of reason.” Whitney
thus moralizes,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Where</span> liuely once, <span class='sc'>Gods</span> image was expreste,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherin, sometime was sacred reason plac’de,</div>
      <div class='line'>The head, I meane, that is so ritchly bleste,</div>
      <div class='line'>With sighte, with smell, with hearinge, and with taste.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lo, nowe a skull, both rotten, bare, and drye,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A relike meete in charnell house to lye.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The device and explanatory lines may well have given
suggestion to the half-serious, half-cynical remarks by Hamlet
in the celebrated grave-yard scene (<cite>Hamlet</cite>, act v. sc. 1, l. 73,
vol. viii. p. 153). A skull is noticed which one of the callous
grave-diggers had just thrown up upon the sod, and Hamlet
says (l. 86),—</p>

<p class='c018'>“That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the knave
jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain’s jaw-bone, that did the first
murder!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And a little further on,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Here’s a fine revolution, an we had the trick to see’t. Did these bones
cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with ’em? mine ache to
think on’t.”<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c015'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And when Yorick’s skull is placed in his hand, how the
Prince moralizes! (l. 177),—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Here hung those lips, that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where
be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell
her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her
laugh at that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And again (lines 191 and 200),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To what base uses we may return. Horatio!</div>
      <div class='c011'>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</div>

      <div class='line'>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Of the skull Anulus says, “Here reason held her citadel;”
and the expression has its parallel in Edward’s lament
(3 <cite>Henry VI.</cite>, act ii. sc. 1, l. 68, vol. v. p. 252),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>when he adds (l. 74),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now my soul’s palace is become a prison;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>to which the more modern description corresponds,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The dome of thought, the palace of the soul.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A far nobler emblem could be made, and I believe has been
made, though I cannot remember where, from those lines in
<cite>Richard II.</cite> (act ii. sc. 1, l. 267, vol. iv. p. 145), which allude to
the death’s head and the light of life within. Northumberland,
Ross and Willoughby are discoursing respecting the sad state
of the king’s affairs, when Ross remarks,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We see the very wreck that we must suffer:</div>
      <div class='line'>And unavoided is the danger now,</div>
      <div class='line'>For suffering so the causes of our wreck.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Northumberland replies in words of hope (l. 270),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death</div>
      <div class='line'>I spy life peering.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is a noble comparison, and most suggestive,—but of a flight
higher than the usual conceptions of the Emblem writers. Supplied
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>to them they could easily enough work it out into device
and picture, but possess scarcely power enough to give it origin.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c015'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

EMBLEM writers make the <em>Natural</em>, one

by it, in Whitney’s words, the
expressing of the natures of creatures,
for example, “the loue of the yonge
Storkes to the oulde, or of such like.”
We shall extend a little the application
of the term, taking in some facts of nature, as well as the natural
properties and qualities of animals, but reserving in a great
degree the Poetry, with which certain natural things are invested,
for the next general heading, “Emblems for Poetic Ideas.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Curious it is to note how slowly the continent which
Columbus discovered became fully recognised as an integral
portion of what had been denominated, ἡ οἰκουμένη,—“the
inhabited world.” The rotundity of the earth and
of the water was acknowledged, but Brucioli’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Trattato
della Sphera</span>,”</span> published at Venice, <span class='fss'>D.M.XLIII.</span>, maintains
that the earth is immovable and the centre of the universe;
and in dividing the globe into climates, it does not
take a single instance except from what is named the
old world; in fact, the new world of America is never mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Somewhat later, in 1564, when Sambucus published his
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span><cite>Emblems</cite>, and presented <cite>Symbols of the parts of the Inhabited

<p class='c000'>The Bull is thus set forth as the <em>alumnus</em>, or nursling of

assigned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare’s geography, however, though at times very
defective, extended further than its “symbols” by Sambucus.
In the humorous mapping out, by Dromio of Syracuse, of the
features of the kitchen-wench, who was determined to be his
wife (<cite>Comedy of Errors</cite>, act iii. sc. 2, l. 131, vol. i. p. 429), the
question is asked,—</p>

<p class='c026'>“<em>Ant. S.</em> Where America, the Indies?</p>
<p class='c026'><em>Dro. S.</em> Oh, sir, upon her nose, all o’er embellished with rubies, carbuncles,
sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Twelfth Night</cite> (act iii. sc. 2, l. 73, vol. iii. p. 271) Maria
thus describes the love-demented steward,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the
augmentation of the Indies; you have not seen such a thing as ’tis.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And in the <cite>Merry Wives of Windsor</cite> (act i. sc. 3, l. 64, vol. i.

Mistress Ford,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“I will be cheaters to them both, and they shall be exchequers to me;
they shall be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to them both.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet in agreement with the map of Sambucus, with the three
capes prominent upon it, of Gibraltar Rock, the Cape of Good
Hope, and that of Malacca, Shakespeare on other occasions
ignores America and all its western neighbours. At the consultation
by Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus, about the division of
the Roman Empire (<cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>, act iv. sc. 1, l. 12, vol. vii.

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The Signs of the Zodiac, or, rather, the figures of the animals
of which the zodiac is composed, were well known in Shakespeare’s
time from various sources; and though they are
Emblems, and have given name to at least one book of
Emblems that was published in 1618,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c015'><sup>[154]</sup></a>—almost within the
limits to which our inquiries are confined,—some may doubt
whether they strictly belong to Emblem writers. Frequently,
however, are they referred to in the dramas of which we are
speaking; and, therefore, it is not out of place to exhibit a
representation of them. This we do from the frontispiece or
title page of an old Italian astronomical work by Antonio
Brucioli (see <a href='#plate13'>Plate XIII</a>.), who was banished from Florence
for his opposition to the Medici, and whose brothers, in 1532,
were printers in Venice. It is not pretended that Shakespeare
was acquainted with this title page, but it supplies an appropriate
illustration of several astronomical phenomena to which
he alludes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The zodiac enters into the description of the advancing day
in <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> (act ii. sc. 1, l. 5, vol. vi. p. 450),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>“As when the golden sun salutes the morn,</div>

      <div class='line'>And overlooks the highest-peering hills;</div>
      <div class='line'>So Tamora.</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,</div>
      <div class='line'>And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>It also occupies a place in a homely comparison in <cite>Measure
for Measure</cite> (act i. sc. 2, l. 158, vol. i. p. 303), to point out the
duration of nineteen years, or the moon’s cycle,—</p>

<p class='c000'>The archery scene in <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> (act iv. sc. 3, l. 52,
vol. vi. p. 501) mentions several of the constellations and the
figures by which they were known. The dialogue is between
Titus and Marcus,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line in2'><em>Marc.</em> This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Bull, being gall’d, gave Aries such a knock</div>
      <div class='line'>That down fell both the Ram’s horns in the court.”</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In allusion to the old medico-astrological idea that the
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>different members of the human body were under the influence
of their proper or peculiar constellations, the following
dialogue occurs in the <cite>Twelfth Night</cite> (act i. sc. 3, l. 127,

</div>

<p class='c000'>Falstaff, in the <cite>Merry Wives of Windsor</cite> (act ii. sc. 2, l. 5,
vol. i. p. 190), vaunts of the good services which he had
rendered to his companions: “I have grated upon my good
friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow Nym:
or else you had looked through the grate, like a geminy of
baboons.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In telling of the folly of waiting on Achilles (<cite>Troilus
and Cressida</cite>, act ii. sc. 3, l. 189, vol. vi. p. 175), Ulysses
declares,—</p>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c000'>The figure of the ninth of the zodiacal constellations,
Sagittarius, is named in <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> (act v. sc. 5,
l. 11, vol. vi. p. 253),—</p>

<p class='c000'>If it be demanded why we do not give a fuller account of
these constellations, we may almost remark as the fool does
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>in <cite>King Lear</cite> (act i. sc. 5, l. 33, vol. viii. p. 295)—“The reason

<p class='c000'>How soon the American bird, which we name a Turkey,
was known in England, is in some degree a subject of
conjecture. It has been supposed that its introduction into
this country is to be ascribed to Sebastian Cabot, who died
in 1557, and that the year 1528 is the exact time; but if so,
it is strange that the bird in question should not have been
called by some other name than that which indicates a
European or an Asiatic origin. Coq d’Inde, or Poule d’Inde,
Gallo d’India, or Gallina d’India, the French and Italian
names, point out the direct American origin, as far as France
and Italy are concerned; for we must remember that the
term India, at the early period of Spanish discovery, was
applied to the western world. But most probably the Turkey
fleet brought the bird into England, by way of Cadiz and
Lisbon, and hence the name; and hence also the reasonableness
of supposing that its permanent introduction into this
country was not so early as the time of Cabot. A general
knowledge of the bird was at any rate spread abroad in
Europe soon after the middle of the sixteenth century, for
we find it figured in the Emblem-books; one of which,
Freitag’s <cite>Mythologia Ethica</cite>, in 1579, p. 237, furnishes a most
lively and exact representation to illustrate “the violated right
of hospitality.”<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c015'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare, no doubt, was familiarly acquainted with the
figure and habits of the Turkey, and yet may have seized for
description some of the expressive delineations and engravings
which occur in the Emblem writers. Freitag’s turkey he
characterises with much exactness, though the sentiment advanced
is more consistent with the lines from Camerarius. In
the <cite>Twelfth Night</cite> (act ii. sc. 5, lines 15, 27, vol. iii. p. 257),
Malvolio, as his arch-tormenter Maria narrates the circumstance,
“has been yonder i’ the sun practising behaviour to his own
shadow this half hour;” he enters on the scene, and Sir Toby
says to Fabian, “Here’s an overweening rogue!” to which the
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>reply is made, “O peace! Contemplation makes a rare
turkey-cock of him; how he jets under his advancing
plumes!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The same action is well hit off in showing the bearing of the
“pragging knave, Pistol,” as Fluellen terms him (<cite>Henry V.</cite>,
act v. sc. 1, l. 13, vol. iv. p. 591),—</p>

<p class='c026'>“<em>Gow.</em>  Why here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.</p>
<p class='c026'><em>Flu.</em>  ’Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his turkey-cocks. God pless
you, Aunchient Pistol! you scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Referring again to the “Prometheus ty’d on Caucasus,” the
Vulture may be accepted as the Emblem of cruel retribution.
So when Falstaff expresses his satisfaction at the death of
Henry IV. (2nd part, act v. sc. 3, l. 134, vol. iv. p. 474), “Blessed
are they that have been my friends; and woe to my lord chief-justice;”
Pistol adds,—</p>

<p class='c000'>A remarkable instance of similarity between Whitney and
Shakespeare occurs in the descriptions
which they both give
of the Commonwealth of Bees.
Whitney, it may be, borrowed
his device (p. 200) from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Hieroglyphica</span>”</span>
of Horus Apollo
(edition 1551, p. 87), where the
question is asked, Πῶς λαὸν πειθήνιον
βασιλεῖ;—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>“How to represent a people obedient to their king? They depict a <span class='fss'>BEE</span>,
for of all animals bees alone have a king, whom the crowd of bees follow,
and to whom as to a king they yield obedience. It is intimated also, as well
from the remarkable usefulness of honey as from the force which the animal
has in its sting, that a king is both useful and powerful for carrying on their
affairs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is worthy of remark that several, if not all, of the Greek
and Roman authors name the head of a hive not a queen but a
king. Plato, in his <cite>Politics</cite> (Francfort edition, 1602, p. 557A).
writes,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Νὺν δὲ γε ὃτε οὐκ ἔστι γιγνόμενος, ὡς δὴ φαμὲν, ἔν ταῖς πόλεσι βασιλεὺς, οἱ~υς ἐν

<p class='c019'>“There is not born, as we say, in cities a king such as is naturally produced
in hives, decidedly differing both in body and soul.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Xenophon’s <cite>Cyropædia</cite> (bk. v. c. 1, § 23) declares of his
hero,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Βασιλεὺς μὲν γὰρ ἔμοιγε δοκεῖς σὺ φυσεί πεφυκέναι, οὐδὲν ἤττον η ἐν τῳ σμῆνει
φυόμενος τῶν μελιττῶν ἡγεμών.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Thou seemest to me to have been formed a king by nature, no less
than he who in the hive is formed general of the bees.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By the side of these stanzas let us place for comparison what
Shakespeare wrote on the same subject,—the Commonwealth of
Bees,—and I am persuaded we shall perceive much similarity of
thought, if not of expression. In <cite>Henry V.</cite> (act i. sc. 2, l. 178,
vol. iv. p. 502), the Duke of Exeter and the Archbishop of Canterbury
enter upon an argument respecting a well-governed
state,—</p>

      <div class='line'>The lazy yawning drone.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Again, in the <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> (act i. sc. 3, l. 75, vol. vi.
p. 144), Ulysses draws from the unsuitableness of a general, as
he terms the ruling bee, over a hive, an explanation of the mischiefs
from an incompetent commander,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the great Hector’s sword had lack’d a master,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for these instances.</div>
      <div class='line'>The specialty of rule hath been neglected:</div>
      <div class='line'>And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand</div>
      <div class='line'>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.</div>
      <div class='line'>When that the general is not like the hive</div>
      <div class='line'>To whom the foragers shall all repair.</div>
      <div class='line'>What honey is expected?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Dramatist’s knowledge of bee-life appears also in the
metaphor used by Warwick (<cite>2 Henry VI.</cite>, act iii. sc. 2, l. 125,
vol. v. p. 168),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>“The commons, like an angry hive of bees,</div>
      <div class='line'>That want their leader, scatter up and down,</div>
      <div class='line'>And care not who they sting in his revenge.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In an earlier play, <cite>2 Henry IV.</cite> (act iv. sc. 5, l. 75, vol. iv.
p. 454), the comparison is taken from the bee-hive,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When, like the bee, culling from every flower</div>
      <div class='line'>The virtuous sweets,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our thighs pack’d with wax, our mouths with honey,</div>
      <div class='line'>We bring it to the hive; and like the bees,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are murdered for our pains.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the foregoing extracts on the bee-king, the plea is inadmissible
that Shakespeare and Whitney went to the same
fountain; for neither of them follows Alciatus. The two
accounts of the economy and policy of these “creatures small”
are almost equally excellent, and present several points of
resemblance, not to name them imitations by the more recent
writer. Whitney speaks of the “Master bee,” Shakespeare of
the king, or “emperor,”—both regarding the head of the hive
not as a queen, but a “born king,” and holding forth the polity
of the busy community as an admirable example of a well-ordered
kingdom or government.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conclusion of Whitney’s reflections on those “that
suck the sweete of <span class='sc'>Flora’s</span> bloomes,” conducts to another
parallelism; and to show it we have only to follow out his idea
of returning home after “absence manie a yeare,” “when happe
some goulden honie bringes.” Here is the whole passage
(p. 201),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And as the bees, that farre and neare doe straye,</div>

      <div class='line'>So, thoughe some men doe linger longe awaye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet loue they best their natiue countries grounde.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And from the same, the more they absent bee,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With more desire, they wishe the same to see.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>Euen so my selfe; throughe absence manie a yeare,</div>

      <div class='line'>Nowe, parentes loue dothe hale mee by the eare,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sayeth, come home, deferre no longer time:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Wherefore, when happe, some goulden honie bringes?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I will retorne, and rest my wearie winges.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The parallel is from <cite>All’s Well that Ends Well</cite> (act i. sc. 2, 1. 58,
vol. iii. p. 119), when the King of France speaks the praise of
Bertram’s father,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“‘Let me not live,’ quoth he,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff</div>
      <div class='line'>Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses</div>
      <div class='line'>All but new things disdain; whose judgments are</div>
      <div class='line'>Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies</div>
      <div class='line'>Expire before their fashions.’ This he wish’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>I after him do after him wish too,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,</div>
      <div class='line'>I quickly were dissolved from my hive,</div>
      <div class='line'>To give some labourers room.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The noble art and sport of Falconry were long the
recreation, and, at times, the eager pursuit of men of high
birth or position. Various notices, collected by Dr. Nathan
Drake, in <cite>Shakespeare and his Times</cite> (vol. i. pp. 255–272), show
that Falconry was—</p>

<p class='c018'>“During the reigns of Elizabeth and James, the most prevalent and
fashionable of all amusements;... it descended from the nobility to the
gentry and wealthy yeomanry, and no man could then have the smallest
pretension to the character of a gentleman who kept not a cast of hawks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From joining in this amusement, or from frequently witnessing
it, Shakespeare gained his knowledge of the sport and of the
technical terms employed in it. We do not even suppose that
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>our pictorial illustration supplied him with suggestions, and we
offer it merely to show that Emblem writers, as well as others,
found in falconry the source of many a poetical expression.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c015'><sup>[158]</sup></a>
The Italian we quote from, Giovio’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“<span class='sc'>Sententiose Imprese</span>”</span>
(Lyons, 1562, p. 41), makes it a mark “of the true nobility;”
but by adding, “So more important things give place,” implies
that it was wrong to let mere amusement occupy the time for
serious affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>Thus we interpret the motto and the stanza,—</p>

      <div class='line in1'>Noble is he, who with virtue’s endowed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Falconers form part of the retinue of the drama (<cite>2

St. Albans even illustrates the expression, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Nobil’ è quel, ch’ è
di virtù dotato,”</span>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Q. Marg.</em> Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,</div>
      <div class='line'>I saw not better sport these seven years’ day:</div>

      <div class='line'>That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>On many other occasions Shakespeare shows his familiarity
with the whole art and mysteries of hawking. Thus Christophero
Sly is asked (<cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite>, Introduction, sc. 2,
l. 41, vol. iii. p. 10),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar</div>
      <div class='line'>Above the morning lark.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Petruchio, after the supper scene, when he had thrown
about the meat and beaten the servants, quietly congratulates
himself on having “politicly began his reign” (act iv. sc. 1,
l. 174, vol. iii. p. 67),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>“My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,</div>
      <div class='line'>And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged;</div>
      <div class='line'>For then she never looks upon her lure.</div>
      <div class='line'>Another way I have to man my haggard,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make her come and know her keeper’s call,</div>
      <div class='line'>That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites</div>
      <div class='line'>That bate and beat and will not be obedient.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Touchstone, too, in <cite>As You Like It</cite> (act iii. sc. 3, 1. 67, vol. ii.
p. 427), hooking several comparisons together, introduces hawking
among them: “As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his
curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as
pigeons bill, so wedlock will be nibbling.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Also in <cite>Macbeth</cite> (act ii. sc. 4, l. 10, vol. vii. p. 459), after
“hours dreadful and things strange,” so “that darkness does the
face of earth entomb, when living light should kiss it,” the Old
Man declares,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in29'>“’Tis unnatural.</div>

<p class='c000'>To renew our youth, like the eagle’s, is an old scriptural

<p class='c000'>The action of the
ostrich in spreading out
its feathers and beating
the wind while it runs,
furnished a device for
Paradin (fol. 23), which,
with the motto, <em>The
feather nothing but the
use</em>, he employs against
hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whitney (p. 51) adopts
motto, device, and meaning,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Hippocrites, that make so great a showe,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Whoe spreades her winges, yet sealdome tries the aire.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A different application is made in <cite>1 Henry IV.</cite> (act iv. sc. 1,
l. 97, vol. iv. p. 317), yet the figure of the bird with outstretching
wings would readily supply the comparison employed by Vernon
while speaking to Hotspur of “the nimbled-footed madcap
Prince of Wales, and his comrades,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It must, however, be conceded, according to Douce’s clear
annotation (vol. i. p. 435), that “it is by no means certain that
this bird (the ostrich) is meant in the present instance.” A line
probably is lost from the passage, and if supplied would only the
more clearly show that the falcon was intended,—“estrich,” in the
old books of falconry, denoting that bird, or, rather, the goshawk.
In this sense the word is used in <cite>Antony and Cleopatra</cite> (act iii.
sc. 13, l. 195, vol. ix. p. 100),—</p>

<p class='c000'>Though a fabulous animal, the Unicorn has properties and
qualities attributed to it which endear it to writers on Heraldry
and on Emblems. These are well, it may with truth be said,
finely set forth in Reusner’s <cite>Emblems</cite> (edition 1581, p. 60), where
the creature is made the ensign for the motto, <em>Faith undefiled

<p class='c000'>A volume of tales and wonders might be collected respecting
the unicorn; for a sketch of these the article on the subject
in the <cite>Penny Cyclopædia</cite> (vol. xxvi. p. 2) may be consulted.
There are the particulars given which Reusner mentions, and
the medical virtues of the horn extolled,<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c015'><sup>[161]</sup></a> which, at one time, it
is said, made it so estimated that it was worth ten times its
weight in gold. It is remarkable that Shakespeare, disposed as
he was, occasionally at least, to magnify nature’s marvels, does
not dwell on the properties of the unicorn, but rather discredits
its existence; for when the strange shapes which Prospero
conjures up to serve the banquet for Alonso make their
appearance (<cite>Tempest</cite>, act iii. sc. 3, l. 21, vol. i. p. 50), Sebastian
avers,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'><span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>“Now I will believe</div>

      <div class='line'>At this hour reigning there.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Timon of Athens (act iv. sc. 3, 1. 331, vol. vii. p. 281) just
hints at the animal’s disposition: “Wert thou the unicorn, pride
and wrath would confound thee, and make thine own self the
conquest of thy fury.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Decius Brutus, in <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> (act ii. sc. 1, l. 203, vol. vii.
p. 347), vaunts of his power to influence Cæsar, and among
other things names the unicorn as a wonder to bring him to
the Capitol. The conspirators doubt whether Cæsar will
come forth;—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Never fear that: if he be so resolved,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The humorous ballad in the <cite>Percy Reliques</cite> (vol. iv. p. 198),
written it is supposed close upon Shakespeare’s times, declares,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Old stories tell, how Hercules</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A dragon slew at Lerna,</div>
      <div class='line'>With seven heads and fourteen eyes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To see and well discern-a:</div>
      <div class='line'>But he had a club, this dragon to drub,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or he had ne’er done it. I warrant ye.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is curious that the device in Corrozet’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Hecatomgraphie</cite></span> of
the Dragon of Lerna should figure forth, in the multiplication
of processes or forms, what Hamlet terms “the law’s
delay.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Corrozet, 1540.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>That is the very subject against which even Hercules,—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“qu’
aqerre honneur par ses nobles conquestes,”</span>—is called into
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>requisition to rid men of the nuisance. We need not quote in
full so familiar a narrative, and which Corrozet embellishes with
twenty-four lines of French verses,—but content ourselves with
a free rendering of his quatrain,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All clever though a man may be in various tricks of law,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though he may think unto the end, his suit contains no flaw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet up there spring forms three or four with which he hardly copes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lawyers’ talk and lawyers’ fees dash down his fondest hopes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>It is not, however, with such speciality that Shakespeare
uses this tale respecting Hercules and the Hydra. On the
occasion serving, the questions may be asked, as in <cite>Hamlet</cite> (act
v. sc. 1, l. 93, vol. viii. p. 154), “Why may not that be the skull
of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his
cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude
knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel,
and will not tell him of his action of battery?”</p>

<p class='c000'>But simply by way of allusion the Hydra is introduced; as
in the account of the battle of Shrewsbury (<cite>1 Henry IV.</cite> act v.
sc. 4, l. 25, vol. iv. p. 342), Douglas had been fighting with one
whom he thought the king, and comes upon “another king:”
“they grow,” he declares, “like Hydra’s heads.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Othello</cite> (act ii. sc. 3, l. 290, vol. vii. p. 498), some time
after the general had said to him (l. 238),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>“Cassio, I love thee;</div>
      <div class='line'>But never more be officer of mine,”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Cassio says to Iago,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard!</div>
      <div class='line'>Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>So of the change which suddenly came over the Prince of
Wales (<cite>Henry V.</cite>, act i. sc. 1, l. 35, vol. iv. p. 493), on his father’s
death, it is said,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in9'>“Never Hydra-headed wilfulness</div>
      <div class='line'>So soon did lose his seat and all at once</div>
      <div class='line'>As in this king.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This section of our subject is sufficiently ample, or we might
press into our service a passage from <cite>Timon of Athens</cite> (act iv.
sc. 3, l. 317, vol. vii. p. 281), in which the question is asked,
“What wouldst thou do with the world, Apemantus, if it lay in
thy power?” and the answer is, “Give it the beasts, to be
rid of the men.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>In the wide range of the pre-Shakespearean Emblematists
and Fabulists we might peradventure find a parallel to each
animal that is named (l. 324),—</p>

<p class='c018'>“If thou wert the lion, the fox would beguile thee: if thou wert the lamb,
the fox would eat thee: if thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect thee
when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy
dulness would torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the
wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou
shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c015'><sup>[162]</sup></a> ... wert thou a bear, thou
wouldst be killed by the horse: wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized
by the leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to the lion, and the
spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life: all thy safety were remotion,
and thy defence absence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so may we take warning, and make our defence for
writing so much,—it is the absence of far more that might be
gathered,—</p>

ALTHOUGH many persons may maintain that the
last two or three examples from the Naturalist’s
division of our subject ought to be reserved as
Emblems to illustrate Poetic Ideas, the animals
themselves may be inventions of the imagination, but the properties
assigned to them appear less poetic than in the instances
which are now to follow. The question, however, is of no great
importance, as this is not a work on Natural History, and a
strictly scientific arrangement is not possible when poets’ fancies
are the guiding powers.</p>

<p class='c000'>How finely and often how splendidly Shakespeare makes use
of the symbolical imagery of his art, a thousand instances might
be brought to show. Three or four only are required to make
plain our meaning. One, from <cite>All’s Well that Ends Well</cite> (act
i. sc. 1, l. 76, vol. iii. p. 112), is Helena’s avowal to herself of her
absorbing love for Bertram,—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in25'>“My imagination</div>
      <div class='line'>Carries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.</div>

      <div class='line'>That I should love a bright particular star</div>
      <div class='line'>And think to wed it, he is so above me:</div>
      <div class='line'>In his bright radiance and collateral light</div>
      <div class='line'>Might I be comforted, not in his sphere.</div>
      <div class='line'>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>The hind that would be mated by the lion</div>
      <div class='line'>Must die of love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,</div>
      <div class='line'>To see him every hour; to sit and draw</div>
      <div class='line'>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</div>
      <div class='line'>In our heart’s table; heart too capable</div>
      <div class='line'>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:</div>
      <div class='line'>But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy</div>
      <div class='line'>Must sanctify his reliques.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another instance shall be from <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> (act iii.
sc. 3, l. 145, vol. vi. p. 198). Neglected by his allies, Achilles
demands, “What, are my deeds forgot?” and Ulysses pours
forth upon him the great argument, that to preserve fame and
honour active exertion is continually demanded,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In vigorous prose Le Bey declares “their home of glory is
the world itself, and for them honour without death abides.”
Then personally to his friend Poppæus he says,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Onward, and things not to be feared fear not thou, who speakest
nothing little or of humble measure, nothing mortal. While the pure
priest of the Muses and of Phœbus with no weak nor unpractised wing

Onward, and let father Phœbus himself bear thee to heaven.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now by the side of Le Bey’s laudatory sentences, may be
placed the Poet’s glory as sung in the <cite>Midsummer Night’s

      <div class='line'>“The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</div>

      <div class='line'>The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</div>

    </div>

<p class='c000'>The Swan of silvery whiteness may have been the heraldic
badge of the Poets, but that “bird of wonder,” the Phœnix,
which,—</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line in12'>“Left sweete Arabie:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>is the source of many more Poetic ideas. To the Emblem
writers as well as to the Poets, who preceded and followed the
time of Shakespeare, it really was a constant theme of admiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the best pictures of what the bird was supposed to be
occurs in Freitag’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Mythologia Ethica</span>”</span> (Antwerp, 1579).
The drawing and execution of the device are remarkably fine;
and the motto enjoins that “youthful studies should be changed
with advancing age,”—</p>

ſecundum deſideria erroris.</em>”</span>—<cite>Epheſ.</cite> 4. 22.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>After describing the bird, Freitag applies it as a type of the
resurrection from the dead; but its special moral is,—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>“That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which
is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Ancient authors, as well as the comparatively modern, very
gravely testify to the lengthened life, and self-renovating power,
and splendid beauty of the Phœnix. In the “<span class='sc'>Euterpe</span>” of
Herodotus (bk. ii. 73) we meet with the following narrative,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Ἔστι δε καὶ ἄλλος ὄμνις,” κ. τ. λ. “There is another sacred bird, named the
Phœnix, which I myself never saw except in picture; for according to the
people of Heliopolis, it seldom makes its appearance among them, only
once in every 500 years. They state that he comes on the death of his
sire. If at all like the picture, this bird may be thus described both in size
and shape. Some of his feathers are of the colour of gold; others are red.
In outline he is exceedingly similar to the Eagle, and in size also. This bird
is said to display an ingenuity of contrivance which to me does not seem
credible: he is represented as coming out of Arabia and bringing with him
his father, embalmed in myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there burying
him. The following is the manner in which this is done. First of all he
sticks together an egg of myrrh, as much as he can carry, and then if he can
bear the burden, this experiment being achieved, he scoops out the egg
sufficiently to deposit his sire within; next he fills with fresh myrrh the
opening in the egg, by which the body was enclosed; thus the whole mass
containing the carcase is still of the same weight. The embalming being
completed, he transports him into Egypt and to the temple of the Sun.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pliny’s account is brief (bk. xiii. ch. iv.),—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The bird Phœnix is supposed to have taken that name from the date
tree, which in Greek is called φοῖνιξ; for the assurance was made me that the
said bird died with the tree, and of itself revived when the tree again
sprouted forth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Numerous indeed are the authorities of old to the same or a
similar purport. They are nearly all comprised in the introductory
dissertation of Joachim Camerarius to his device of the
Phœnix, and include about eighteen classic writers, ten of the
Greek and Latin Fathers, and three modern writers of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>Appended to the works of Lactantius, an eloquent Christian
Father of the latter part of the third century, there is a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Carmen
De Phœnice</cite></span>,—“Song concerning the Phœnix,”—in elegiac verse,
which contains very many of the old tales and legends of “the
Arabian bird,” and describes it as,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c000'>(See <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Lactantii Opera, studio Gallæi</cite></span>, Leyden, 8vo. 1660, pp.
904–923.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides Camerarius, there are at least five Emblematists
from whom Shakespeare might have borrowed respecting
the Phœnix. Horapollo, whose <cite>Hieroglyphics</cite> were edited
in 1551; Claude Paradin and Gabriel Symeoni, whose <cite>Heroic
Devises</cite> appeared in 1562; Arnold Freitag, in 1579; Nicholas
Reusner, in 1581; Geffrey Whitney, in 1586, and Boissard, in
1588,—these all take the Phœnix for one of their emblems, and
give a drawing of it in the act of self-sacrifice and self-renovation.
They make it typical of many truths and
doctrines,—of long duration for the soul, of devoted love to
God, of special rarity of character, of Christ’s resurrection
from the dead, and of the resurrection of all mankind.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a singular application of the Phœnix emblem
which existed before and during Shakespeare’s time, but of
which I find no pictorial representation until 1633. It is in
Henry Hawkins’ rare volume, “Η ΠΑΡΘΕΝΟΣ,”—<cite>The Virgin</cite>—“Symbolically
set forth and enriched with piovs devises and
emblemes for the entertainement of Devovt Sovles.” This
peculiar emblem bestows upon the bird two hearts, which are
united in closest sympathy and in entire oneness of affection and
purpose; they are the hearts of the Virgin-Mother and her Son.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whitney’s and Shakespeare’s uses of the device resemble

considerable degree makes the explanatory stanzas his own
both in the conception and in the expression. The chief
town near to his birth-place had on December 10, 1583,
been almost totally destroyed by fire, but through the
munificence of the Queen and many friends, by 1586, “the
whole site and frame of the town, so suddenly ruined, was
with great speed re-edified in that beautifull manner,” says
the chronicler, “that now it is.” The Phœnix (p. 177) is
standing in the midst of the flames, and with outspreading
wings is prepared for another flight in renewed youth and
vigour.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the fullest and most remarkable example is from <cite>Henry
VIII.</cite> (act v. sc. 5, l. 28, vol. vi. p. 114). Cranmer assumes the
gift of inspiration, and prophesies of the new-born child of the
king and of Anne Bullen an increase of blessings and of all

      <div class='line'>And so stand fix’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is another bird, the emblem of tranquillity and of
peaceful and happy days; it is the <span class='sc'>King-fisher</span>, which the
poets have described with the utmost embellishment of the
fancy. Aristotle and Pliny tell even more marvellous tales
about it than Herodotus and Horapollo do about the Phœnix.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fable, on which the poetic idea rests, is two-fold; one
that Alcyone, a daughter of the wind-god Æolus, had been
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>married to Ceyx; and so happily did they live that they gave
one another the appellations of the gods, and by Jupiter in
anger were changed into birds; the other narrates, that Ceyx
perished from shipwreck, and that in a passion of grief Alcyone
threw herself into the sea. Out of pity the gods bestowed on
the two the shape and habit of birds. Ovid has greatly enlarged
the fable, and has devoted to it, in his <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> (xi. 10),
between three and four hundred lines. We have only to do
with the conclusion,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“The gods at length taking compassion</div>
      <div class='line'>The pair are transformed into birds; tried by one destiny</div>
      <div class='line'>Their love remained firm; nor is the conjugal bond</div>
      <div class='line'>Loosened although they are birds; parents they become,</div>
      <div class='line'>And through a seven days’ quietness in midwinter</div>
      <div class='line'>In nests upborne by the sea the King-fishers breed.</div>
      <div class='line'>Safe then is the sea-road; the winds Æolus guards,</div>
      <div class='line'>Debarring from egress; and ocean’s plain favours his children.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>According to Aristotle’s description (<cite>Hist. Anim.</cite> ix. 14),—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The nest of the Alcyon is globular, with a very narrow entrance, so that
if it should be upset the water would not enter. A blow from iron has no
effect upon it, but the human hand soon crushes it and reduces it to powder.
The eggs are five.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“The <em>halcyones</em>,” Pliny avers, “are of great name and much marked.
The very seas, and they that saile thereupon, know well when they sit and
breed. This bird, so notable, is little bigger than a sparrow; for the more
part of her pennage, blew, intermingled yet among with white and purple
feathers; having a thin small neck and long withal they lay and sit about
mid-winter, when daies be shortest; and the times while they are broodie, is
called the <em>halcyon</em> daies; for during that season the sea is calm and
navigable, especially on the coast of Sicilie.”—<cite>Philemon Holland’s Plinie</cite>, x. 32.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are thus prepared for the device which Paolo Giovio sets
before his readers, with an Italian four-lined stanza to a French
motto, <em>We know well the weather</em>. The drawing suggests that
the two Alcyons in one nest are sailing “on the coast of Sicilie,”
in the straits of Messina, with Scylla and Charybdis on each
hand—but in perfect calmness and security,—</p>

<p class='c000'>The festival of Saint Martin, or Martlemas, is held November
11th, at the approach of winter, and was a season of merriment
and good cheer. It is in connection with this festival that Shakespeare
first introduces a mention of the Alcyon (<cite>1 Henry VI.</cite>,
act i. sc. 2, l. 129, vol. v. p. 14). The Maid of Orleans is propounding
her mission for the deliverance of France to Reignier, Duke
of Anjou,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Assign’d I am to be the English scourge.</div>

      <div class='line'>Since I have enter’d into these wars.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>It was, and I believe still is, an opinion prevalent in some
parts of England, that a King-fisher, suspended by the tail or
beak, will turn round as the wind changes. To this fancy, allusion
is made in <cite>King Lear</cite> (act ii. sc. 2, l. 73, vol. viii. p. 307),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Renege, affirm and turn their halcyon beaks</div>

<p class='c000'>The Poet delights to tell of self-sacrificing love; and hence the
celebrity which the <span class='sc'>Pelican</span> has acquired for the strong natural
affection which impels it, so the tale runs, to pour forth the very
fountain of its life in nourishment to its young. From Epiphanius,
bishop of Constantia in the island of Cyprus, whose <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Physiologvs</cite></span>
was printed by Plantin in 1588, we have the supposed natural
history of the Pelicans and their young, which he symbolizes in
the Saviour. His account is accompanied by a pictorial representation,
“ΠΕΡΙ ΤΗΣ ΠΕΛΕΚΑΝΟΣ,”—<cite>Concerning the Pelican</cite>
(p. 30).</p>

<div id='i176'  class='figcenter id023'>
<img src='images/img176.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Epiphanius, 1588.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>The good bishop narrates as physiological history the following,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Beyond all birds the Pelican is fond of her young. The female sits on
the nest, guarding her offspring, and cherishes and caresses them and wounds
them with loving; and pierces their sides and they die. After three days
the male pelican comes and finds them dead, and very much his heart is
pained. Driven by grief he smites his own side, and as he stands over the
wounds of the dead young ones, the blood trickles down, and thus are they
made alive again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Reusner and Camerarius both adopt the Pelican as the
emblem of a good king who devotes himself to the people’s
welfare. <em>For Law and for Flock</em>, is the very appropriate motto
they prefix; Camerarius simply saying (ed. 1596, p. 87),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>Sanguine vivificat Pelicanus pignora, sic rex</em></span></div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“By blood the Pelican his young revives; and so a king</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For his people’s sake himself of life is prodigal.”</div>
    </div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span>And tells how,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Alphonsus the wise and good king of Naples, with his own honoured
hand painted a Pelican which with its sharp beak was laying open its breast
so as with its own blood to save the lives of its young. Thus for people, for
law, it is right that a king should die and by his own death restore life to the
nations. As by his own death Christ did restore life to the just, and with
life peace and righteousness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He adds this personification of the Pelican,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For people and for sanctioned law heart’s life a king will pour;</div>
      <div class='line'>So from this blood of mine do I life to my young restore.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The other motto, which Hadrian Junius and Geffrey Whitney
select, opens out another idea, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Quod in te est, prome</em></span>,—“Bring
forth what is in thee.” It suggests that of the soul’s wealth we
should impart to others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Junius (Emb. 7) thus addresses the bird he has chosen,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“By often striking, O Pelican, thou layest open the deep recesses of thy
breast and givest life to thy offspring. Search into thine own mind (my
friend), seek what is hidden within, and bring forth into the light the seeds
of thine inner powers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And very admirably does Whitney (p. 87) apply the sentiment
to one of the most eminent of divines in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth,—namely, to Dr. Alexander Nowell, the
celebrated Dean of St. Paul’s, illustrious both for his learning
and his example,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Pellican, for to reuiue her younge,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Doth peirce her brest, and geue them of her blood:</div>
      <div class='line'>Then searche your breste, and as yow haue with tonge,</div>
      <div class='line'>With penne proceede to doe our countrie good:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Your zeale is great, your learning is profounde,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then helpe our wantes, with that you doe abounde.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The full poetry of the thoughts thus connected with the
Pelican is taken in, though but briefly expressed by Shakespeare.
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>In <cite>Hamlet</cite> (act iv. sc. 5, l. 135, vol. viii. p. 135), on
Laertes determining to seek revenge for his father’s death, the
king adds fuel to the flame,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>King.</em> <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Good Laertes,</span></div>
      <div class='line'>If you desire to know the certainty</div>
      <div class='line'>Of your dear father’s death, is’t writ in your revenge,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Winner and loser?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Laer.</em> None but his enemies.</div>

      <div class='line'>And like the kind life-rendering pelican,</div>
      <div class='line'>Repast them with my blood.”<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c015'><sup>[167]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>From <cite>Richard II.</cite> (act ii. sc. 1, l. 120, vol. iv. p. 140) we learn
how in zeal and true loyalty John of Gaunt counsels his headstrong
nephew, and how rudely the young king replies,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now, by my seat’s right royal majesty,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wert thou not brother to great Edward’s son,</div>
      <div class='line'>This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head</div>
      <div class='line'>Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Gaunt.</em> O, spare me not, my brother Edward’s son,</div>
      <div class='line'>For that I was his father Edward’s son;</div>
      <div class='line'>That blood already, like the pelican,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hast thou tapp’d out and drunkenly caroused.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The idea, indeed, almost supposes that the young pelicans
strike at the breasts of the old ones, and forcibly or thoughtlessly
drain their life out. So it is in <cite>King Lear</cite> (act iii. sc. 4,
l. 68, vol. viii. p. 342), when the old king exclaims,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c000'>And again (<cite>2 Henry VI.</cite>, act iv. sc. 1, l. 83, vol. v. p. 182), in
the words addressed to Suffolk,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“By devilish policy art thou grown great,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The description of the wounded stag, rehearsed to the
banished duke by one of his attendants, is as touching a narrative,
as full of tenderness, as any which show the Poet’s
wonderful power over our feelings; it is from <cite>As You Like It</cite>
(act ii. sc. 1, l. 29, vol. ii. p. 394),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself</div>
      <div class='line'>Did steal behind him [<em>Jaques</em>] as he lay along</div>
      <div class='line'>Under an oak whose antique root peeps out</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:</div>
      <div class='line'>To the which place a poor sequester’d stag,</div>
      <div class='line'>That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wretched animal heaved forth such groans,</div>
      <div class='line'>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</div>
      <div class='line'>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</div>
      <div class='line'>Coursed one another down his innocent nose</div>
      <div class='line'>In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,</div>
      <div class='line'>Much marked of the melancholy Jacques,</div>

      <div class='line'>Augmenting it with tears.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Graphic and highly ornamented though this description may
be, it is really the counterpart of Gabriel Symeoni’s Emblem of
love incurable. The poor stag lies wounded and helpless,—the
mortal dart in his flank, and the life-stream gushing out. The
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>scroll above bears a Spanish motto, <em>This holds their Remedy and

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>To the same motto and the same device Paradin (fol. 168)
furnishes an explanation,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“<em>The device of love incurable,</em>” he says, “<em>may be a stag wounded by an
arrow, having a branch of Dittany in its mouth, which is a herb that grows
abundantly in the island of Crete. By eating this the wounded stag heals all
its injuries. The motto,</em> <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">‘Esto tienne su remedio, y no yo,’</span> <em>follows those
verses of Ovid in the Metamorphoses, where Phœbus, complaining of the love
for Daphne, says, ‘<span class="blackletter">Hei mihi, quòd nullis amor est medicabilis herbis</span>.’</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>The connected lines in Ovid’s <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> (bk. i. fab. 9), show
that even Apollo, the god of healing, whose skill does good to all
others, does no good to himself. The <cite>Emblems</cite> of Otho Vænius
(p. 154) gives a very similar account to that of Symeoni,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Cerua venenato venantûm saucia ferro</em></span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the presence of those who had slain Cæsar, and over his
dead body at the foot of Pompey’s statue, “which all the while ran
blood,” Marc Antony poured forth his fine avowal of continued
fidelity to his friend (<cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>, act iii. sc. 1, l. 205, vol. vii. p.
368),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay’d, brave hart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sign’d in thy spoil and crimson’d in thy lethe.</div>
      <div class='line'>O world! thou wast the forest to this hart;</div>
      <div class='line'>And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</div>
      <div class='line'>How like a deer strucken by many princes</div>
      <div class='line'>Dost thou here lie!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The same metaphor from the wounded deer is introduced in
<cite>Hamlet</cite> (act iii. sc. 2, l. 259, vol. viii. p. 97). The acting of the
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>play has had on the king’s mind the influence which Hamlet
hoped for; and as in haste and confusion the royal party disperse,
he recites the stanza,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why, let the stricken deer go weep,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The hart ungalled play;</div>
      <div class='line'>For some must watch, whilst some must sleep:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus runs the world away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The very briefest allusion to the subject of our Emblem is
also contained in the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite> (act i. sc. 2, l. 115, vol. iii.
p. 323). Leontes is discoursing with his queen Hermione,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,</div>
      <div class='line'>As now they are, and making practised smiles,</div>
      <div class='line'>As in a looking glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere</div>
      <div class='line'>The mort o’ the deer; O, that is entertainment</div>
      <div class='line'>My bosom likes not, nor my brows!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The poetical epithet “golden,” so frequently expressive of
excellence and perfection, and applied even to qualities of the
mind, is declared by Douce (vol. i. p. 84) to have been derived
by Shakespeare either from Sidney’s <cite>Arcadia</cite> (bk. ii.), or from
Arthur Golding’s translation of Ovid’s <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> (4to,
fol. 8), where speaking of Cupid’s arrows, he says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>That causeth love</em> is all of <em>golde</em> with point full sharp and bright.</div>
      <div class='line'>That chaseth love, is blunt, whose steele with leaden head is dight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This borrowing and using of the epithet “golden” might
equally well, and with as much probability, have taken place
through the influence of Alciat, or by adoption from Whitney’s
very beautiful translation and paraphrase of Joachim Bellay’s
<cite>Fable of Cupid and Death</cite>. The two were lodging together at
an inn,<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c015'><sup>[169]</sup></a> and unintentionally exchanged quivers: death’s darts
were made of bone, Cupid’s were “dartes of goulde.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>The conception of the tale is admirable, and the narrative
itself full of taste and beauty. Premising that the same device
is employed by Whitney as by Alciat, we will first give almost
a literal version from the 154th and 155th Emblems of the
latter author (edition 1581),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wandering about was Death along with Cupid as companion,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With himself Death was bearing quivers; little Love his weapons;</div>
      <div class='line'>Together at an inn they lodged; one night together one bed they shared;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Love was blind, and on this occasion Death also was blind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Unforeseeing the evil, one took the darts of the other,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Death the golden weapons,—those of bone the boy rashly seizes.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hence an old man who ought now to be near upon Acheron.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Behold him loving,—and for his brow flower-fillets preparing.</div>
      <div class='line'>But I, since Love smote me with the dart that was changed,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I am fainting, and their hand the fates upon me are laying.</div>
      <div class='line'>Spare, O boy; spare, O Death, holding the ensigns victorious,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Make me the lover, the old man make him sink beneath Acheron.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And carrying on the idea into the next Emblem (155),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why, O Death, with thy wiles darest thou deceive Love the boy,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That thy weapons he should hurl, while he thinks them his own?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whitney’s “sportive tale, concerning death and love,”
possesses sufficient merit to be given in full (p. 132),—</p>

<p class='c000'>For an interlude to our remarks on the “golden,” we must
mention that the pretty tale <cite>Concerning Death and Cupid</cite> was
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span>attributed to Whitney by one of Shakespeare’s contemporaries;
and, if known to other literary men of the age, very reasonably
may be supposed not unknown to the dramatist. Henry
Peacham, in 1612, p. 172 of his <cite>Emblems</cite>, acknowledges that it
was from Whitney that he derived his own tale,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='c011'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>De Morte, et Cupidine.</em>”</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Death</span> meeting once, with <em><span class='sc'>Cvpid</span></em> in an Inne,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where roome was scant, togeither both they lay.</div>
      <div class='line'>Both weariè, (for they roving both had beene,)</div>
      <div class='line'>Now on the morrow when they should away,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em><span class='sc'>Cvpid</span></em> Death’s quiver at his back had throwne,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By this o’re-sight, it shortly came to passe,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Giue <em><span class='sc'>Cvpid’s</span></em> dartes, and <em>Death</em> take thine againe.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whitney luxuriates in this epithet “golden;”—golden fleece,
golden hour, golden pen, golden sentence, golden book, golden
palm are found recorded in his pages. At p. 214 we have the
lines,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A Leaden sworde, within a goulden sheathe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is like a foole of natures finest moulde,</div>
      <div class='line'>To whome, shee did her rarest giftes bequethe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or like a sheepe, within a fleece of goulde.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We may indeed regard Whitney as the prototype of Hood’s
world-famous “Miss Kilmansegg, with her golden leg,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And a pair of Golden Crutches.” (vol. i. p. 189.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare is scarcely more sparing in this respect than the
Cheshire Emblematist; he mentions for us “golden tresses of
the dead,” “golden oars and a silver stream,” “the glory, that in
gold clasps locks in the golden story,” “a golden casket,” “a
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>golden bed,” and “a golden mind.” <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> (act ii.
sc. 7, lines 20 and 58, vol. ii. p. 312),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.</div>
      <div class='c011'>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</div>
      <div class='line'>But here an angel in a golden bed</div>
      <div class='line'>Lies all within.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And applied direct to Cupid’s artillery in <cite>Midsummer Night’s
Dream</cite> (act i. sc. 1, l. 168, vol. ii. p. 204), Hermia makes fine use
of the epithet golden,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>“My good Lysander!</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>So in <cite>Twelfth Night</cite> (act i. sc. 1, l. 33, vol. iii. p. 224), Orsino,
Duke of Milan, speaks of Olivia,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame</div>

<p class='c000'>As Whitney’s pictorial illustration represents them, Death and
Cupid are flying in mid-air, and discharging their arrows from the
clouds. Confining the description to Cupid, this is exactly the
action in one of the scenes of the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>
(act ii. sc. 1, l. 155, vol. ii. p. 216). The passage was intended
to flatter Queen Elizabeth; it is Oberon who speaks,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,</div>
      <div class='line'>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>Cupid all arm’d: a certain aim he took</div>
      <div class='line'>At a fair vestal throned by the west,</div>
      <div class='line'>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</div>
      <div class='line'>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts:</div>
      <div class='line'>But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft</div>
      <div class='line'>Quench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the imperial votaress passed on,</div>
      <div class='line'>In maiden meditation, fancy free.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:</div>
      <div class='line'>It fell upon a little western flower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,</div>
      <div class='line'>And maidens call it love-in-idleness.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely by possibility could a dramatist, who was also an
actor, avoid the imagery of poetic ideas with which his own
profession made him familiar. I am not sure if Sheridan
Knowles did not escape the temptation; but if Shakespeare had
done so, it would have deprived the world of some of the most
forcible passages in our language. The theatre for which he
wrote, and the stage on which he acted, supplied materials for
his imagination to work into lines of surpassing beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boissard’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Theatrvm Vitæ Humanæ</span>”</span> (edition Metz, 4to,
1596) presents its first Emblem with the title,—<em>Human life
is as a Theatre of all Miseries</em>. (See Plate <a href='#plate14'>XIV</a>.)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The life of man a circus is, or theatre so grand:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which every thing shows forth filled full of tragic fear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here wanton sense, and sin, and death, and Satan’s hand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Molest mankind and persecute with penalties severe.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The picture of human life which Boissard draws in his
“Address to the Reader” is gloomy and dispiriting; there are in
it, he declares, the various miseries and calamities to which man is
subject while he lives,—and the conflicts to which he is exposed
from the sharpest and cruellest enemies, the devil, the flesh, and
the world; and from their violence and oppression there is no possibility
of escape, except by the favour and help of God’s mercy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very similar ideas prevail in some of Shakespeare’s lines; as
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span>“the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to” (<cite>Hamlet</cite>,
act iii. sc. 1, l. 62, vol. viii. p. 79); “my heart all mad with misery
beats in this hollow prison of my flesh” (<cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>,
act iii. sc. 2, l. 9, vol. vi. p. 483); and, “shake the yoke of inauspicious
stars from this world-wearied flesh” (<cite>Romeo and
Juliet</cite>, act v. sc. 3, l. 111, vol. vii. p. 126).</p>

<p class='c000'>But more particularly in <cite>As You Like It</cite> (act ii. sc. 7, l. 136,
vol. ii. p. 409),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:</div>
      <div class='line'>This wide and universal theatre</div>
      <div class='line'>Presents more woeful pageants than the scene</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherein we play in.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Also in <cite>Macbeth</cite> (act v. sc. 5, l. 22, vol. vii. p. 512),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</div>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c000'>And when the citizens of Angiers haughtily closed their gates

<p><em>Seven Ages of Life from an early Block Print in the British Museum</em></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The stages or ages of man have been variously divided. In
the Arundel MS., and in a Dutch work printed at Antwerp in
1820, there are ten of these divisions of Man’s Life.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c015'><sup>[170]</sup></a> The
celebrated physician Hippocrates (<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 460–357), and Proclus,
<span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span>the Platonist (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 412–485), are said to have divided human
life, as Shakespeare has done, into <em>seven</em> ages. And a mosaic on
the pavement of the cathedral at Siena gives exactly the same
division. This mosaic is very curious, and is supposed to have
been executed by Antonio Federighi in the year 1476. Martin’s
“<span class='sc'>Shakspere’s Seven Ages</span>,” published in 1848, contains a
little narrative about it, furnished by Lady Calcott, who shortly
before that time had been travelling in Italy,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“We found,” she says, “in the cathedral of Sienna a curious proof that
the division of human life into seven periods, from infancy to extreme old age
with a view to draw a moral inference, was common before Shakspeare’s
time: the person who was showing us that fine church directed our
attention to the large and bold designs of Beccafumi, which are inlaid in
black and white in the pavement, entirely neglecting some works of a much
older date which appeared to us to be still more interesting on account of the
simplicity and elegance with which they are designed. Several of these
represent Sibyls and other figures of a mixed moral and religious character;
but in one of the side chapels we were both suprised and pleased to find
seven figures, each in a separate compartment, inlaid in the pavement,
representing the Seven Ages of Man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Lindsay notices the same work, and in his “<span class='sc'>Christian
Art</span>,” vol. iii. p. 112, speaking of the Pavement of the Duomo at
Siena, says,—“Seven ages of life in the Southern Nave, near
the Capella del Voto.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of as old a date, even if not more ancient, is the Representation
of the Seven Ages from a Block-Print belonging to the
British Museum, and of which we present a diminished facsimile
(Plate XV.), the original measuring 15½ in. by 10½ in.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscription on the centre of the wheel, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Rota vite que
septima notatur</em></span>,—“The wheel of life which seven times is noted:”
on the outer rim,—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Est velut aqua labuntur deficiens ita. Sic
ornati nascuntur in hac mortali vita</em></span>,—“It is as water so failing,
they pass away. So furished are they born in this mortal
life.” The figures for the seven ages are inscribed, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Infans ad vii.
<span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span>annos</em></span>,—“An infant for vii. years.” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Pueritia</em><a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c015'><sup>[171]</sup></a> <em>ad xv. años</em></span>,—“Childhood

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Decrepitus usque ad mortem</em></span>,—“Decrepitude up to death.” The
angel with the scrolls holds in her right hand that on which is
written <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Beuerano</em></span>, in her left, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Corruptio</em></span>,—“Corruption;” below
her left, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>clav</em></span>, for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>clavis</em></span>, “a key.”</p>

the Emblematical Devices in the foregoing Block-print. The

      <div class='line'>And one man in his time plays many parts,</div>
      <div class='line'>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</div>
      <div class='line'>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</div>
      <div class='line'>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</div>
      <div class='line'>Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,</div>
      <div class='line'>Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,</div>
      <div class='line'>Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seeking the bubble reputation</div>
      <div class='line'>Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,</div>
      <div class='line'>In fair round belly with good capon lined,</div>
      <div class='line'>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</div>
      <div class='line'>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</div>
      <div class='line'>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,</div>
      <div class='line'>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</div>
      <div class='line'>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</div>
      <div class='line'>For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</div>
      <div class='line'>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>That ends this strange eventful history,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>In far briefer phrase, but with a similar comparison, in reply
to the charge of having “too much respect upon the world,”
Antonia (<cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, act i. sc. 1, l. 77, vol. ii. p. 281)
remarked,—</p>

<p class='c000'>The pencil and the skill alone are wanting to multiply the
Emblems for the Poetic Ideas which abound in Shakespeare’s
dramas. His thoughts and their combinations are in general
so clothed with life and with other elements of beauty, that
materials for pictures exist in all parts of his writings. Our
office, however, is not to exercise the inventive faculty, nor, even
when the invention has been perfected for us by the poet’s fancy,
to give it a visible form and to portray its outward graces. We
have simply to gather up the scattered records of the past, and
to show what correspondencies there really are between Shakespeare
and the elder Emblem artists, and, when we can, to point
out where to him they have been models, imitated and thus
approved. Though, therefore, we might draw many a sketch, and
finish many a picture from ideas to be supplied from this unexhausted
fountain, we are mindful of the humbler task belonging
to him who collects, and on his shelf of literary antiquities
places, only what has the stamp of nearly three centuries upon
them.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>We will initiate this division
by the motto and
device which Whitney (p.
64) adopts from Sambucus
(edition 1564, p. 30),—“Things
lying at our
feet,”—that is, of immediate
importance and
urgency. The Emblems
are warnings from the
hen which is eating her
own eggs, and from the cow which is drinking her own milk.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hungarian poet thus sets forth his theme,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The hen which had seen the eggs to her care entrusted,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Is here sucking them, and hope she holds forth by no pledge.</div>
      <div class='line'>It is herself she serves and not others,—of future days heedless,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>No sense of feeling has she for the good of posterity.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>This a fault is in many,—things gained without labour</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thoughtless they waste, unmindful of times that are coming.</div>
      <div class='line'>So cows suck their own udders,—the milk proper for milk pails</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They pilfer away,—and why bear to them the rich fodder?</div>
      <div class='line'>Not alone for ourselves do we live,—we live from the birth hour</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For our friends and our country, and whom the ages shall bring.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The sentiment is admirable, and well placed by Whitney in the
foremost ground,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Not for our selues, alone wee are create,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for our frendes, and for our countries good:</div>
      <div class='line'>And those, that are vnto theire frendes ingrate,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not regarde theire ofspringe, and theire blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or hee, that wastes his substance till he begges,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or selles his landes, which seru’de his parentes well:</div>
      <div class='line'>Is like the henne, when shee hathe lay’de her egges,</div>
      <div class='line'>That suckes them vp and leaues the emptie shell,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Euen so theire spoile, to theire reproche, and shame,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Vndoeth theire heire, and quite decayeth theire name.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These two, Sambucus and Whitney, are the types, affirming
that our powers and gifts and opportunities were all bestowed,
not for mere selfish enjoyments, but to be improved for the
general welfare; Shakespeare is the antitype: he amplifies, and
exalts, and finishes; he carries out the thought to its completion,
and thus attains absolute perfection; for in <cite>Measure for
Measure</cite> (act i. sc. 1, l. 28, vol. i. p. 296), Vincentio, the duke,
addresses Angelo,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There is a kind of character in thy life,</div>
      <div class='line'>That to th’ observer doth thy history</div>
      <div class='line'>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</div>
      <div class='line'>Are not thine own so proper, as to waste</div>
      <div class='line'>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not light them for ourselves; for if our virtues</div>
      <div class='line'>Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike</div>
      <div class='line'>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch’d</div>
      <div class='line'>But to fine issues; nor Nature never lends</div>
      <div class='line'>The smallest scruple of her excellence,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</div>
      <div class='line'>Herself the glory of a creditor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Both thanks and use.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now, there is beauty in the types, brief though they be, and
on a very lowly subject: but how admirable is the antitype!
It entirely redeems the thought from any associated meanness,
carries it out to its full excellence, and clothes it with vestments
of inspiration. Such, in truth, is Shakespeare’s great praise;—he
can lift another man’s thought out of the dust, and make it
a fitting ornament even for an archangel’s diadem.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of Whitney’s finest Emblems, in point of conception
and treatment, and, I believe, peculiar to himself, one of
those “newly devised,” is founded on the sentiment, “By
help of God” (p. 203).</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The representation is
that of the hand of Divine
Providence issuing from a
cloud and holding the girdle
which encompasses the
earth. With that girdle
Sir Francis Drake’s ship,
“the Golden Hind,” was
drawn and guided round
the globe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole Emblem
possesses considerable interest,—for
it relates to
the great national event of
Shakespeare’s youth,—the first accomplishment by Englishmen
of the earth’s circumnavigation. With no more than 164 able-bodied
men, in five small ships, little superior to boats with a
deck, the adventurous commander set sail 13th December, 1577;
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span>he went by the Straits of Magellan, and on his return doubled
the Cape of Good Hope, the 15th of March, 1580, having then
only fifty-seven men and three casks of water. The perilous
voyage was ended at Plymouth, September the 26th, 1580, after
an absence of two years and ten months.</p>

<p class='c000'>These few particulars give more meaning to the Poet’s description,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>By gapinge gulfes hee pass’d, by monsters of the flood,</div>

      <div class='line'>Sir <span class='sc'>Francis Drake</span>, by due deserte, may weare the goulden palme.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How similar, in part at least, is the sentiment in <cite>Hamlet</cite>
(act v. sc. 2, l. 8, vol. viii. p. 164),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well</div>
      <div class='line'>When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rough-hew them how we will.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the Emblem we may note the girdle by which Drake’s
ship is guided; may it not have been the origin of Puck’s fancy
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>in the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> (act ii. sc. 1, l. 173, vol. ii.
p. 216), when he answers Oberon’s strict command,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“And be thou here again</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere the Leviathan can swim a league.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Puck.</em> I’ll put a girdle round about the earth</div>
      <div class='line'>In forty minutes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Besides, may it not have been from this voyage of Sir
Francis Drake, and the accounts which were published respecting
it, that the correct knowledge of physical geography was
derived which Richard II. displays (act iii. sc. 2, l. 37, &amp;c.
vol. iv. p. 165)? as in the lines,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“when the searching eye of heaven is hid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Behind the globe, that lights the lower world.</div>
      <div class='c011'>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</div>
      <div class='line in15'>when from under this terrestrial ball</div>
      <div class='line'>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</div>
      <div class='line'>And darts his light through every guilty hole.</div>
      <div class='c011'>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</div>
      <div class='line in19'>revell’d in the night</div>
      <div class='line'>Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A mere passing allusion to the same sentiment, a hint respecting
it, a single line expressing it, or only a word or two
relating to it, may sometimes very decidedly indicate an
acquaintance with the author by whom the sentiment has been
enunciated in all its fulness. Thus, Shakespeare, in speaking of
Benedick, in <cite>Much Ado about Nothing</cite> (act v. sc. 1, l. 170, vol. ii.
p. 75), makes Don Pedro say,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“An if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly: the old
man’s daughter told us all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To which Claudius replies,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, Whitney (p. 229) has an Emblem on this very
subject; the motto, “God lives and sees.” It depicts Adam
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>concealing himself, and a divine light circling the words, “<span class='sc'>Vbi
es?</span>”—<em>Where art thou?</em></p>

Georgette de Montenay (editions 1584 and 1620) carries out the
same thought,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Adam pensoit estre fort bien caché,</em></span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The similarity is too great to be named on Shakespeare’s
part an accidental coincidence; it may surely be set down as
a direct allusion, not indeed of the mere copyist, but of the
writer, who, having in his mind another’s thought, does not
quote it literally, but gives no uncertain indication that he
gathered it up he cannot tell where, yet has incorporated it
among his own treasures, and makes use of it as entirely
his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Corrozet, Georgette de Montenay, Le Bey de Batilly,
and others their contemporaries, we might adduce various
Moral and Æsthetical Emblems to which there are similarities
of thought or of expression in Shakespeare’s Dramas, but too
slight to deserve special notice. For instance, there are ingratitude,
the instability of the world, faith and charity and hope,
calumny, adversity, friendship, fearlessness,—but to dwell upon
them would lengthen our statements and remarks more than
is necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>We will, however, make one more extract from Corrozet’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Hecatomgraphie</span>”</span> (Emb. 83); to the motto, <em>Beauty the
companion of goodness</em>; which might have been in Duke Vincentio’s
mind (<cite>Measure for Measure</cite>, act iii. sc. 1, l. 175, vol. i.
p. 340) when he addressed Isabel,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the goodness
that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being
the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair.”</p>

</div>

</div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>The French verse which immediately follows the Emblem well
describes it,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As, for the precious stone</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The ring of gold is coin’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>So, beauty in its grace</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Should be to goodness join’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The dramas we have liberty to select from furnish several
instances of the same thought. First, from the <cite>Two Gentlemen
of Verona</cite> (act iv. sc. 2, l. 38, vol. i. p. 135), in that exquisitely
beautiful little song which answers the question, “Who is
Silvia?”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who is Silvia? what is she,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That all our swains commend her?</div>
      <div class='line'>Holy, fair, and wise is she;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The heaven such grace did lend her,</div>
      <div class='line'>That she might admired be.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Is she kind as she is fair?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For beauty lives with kindness.</div>
      <div class='line'>Love doth to her eyes repair,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To help him of his blindness,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, being help’d, inhabits there.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then to Silvia let us sing,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That Silvia is excelling;</div>
      <div class='line'>She excels each mortal thing</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Upon the dull earth dwelling:</div>
      <div class='line'>To her let us garlands bring.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But a closer parallelism to Corrozet’s Emblem of beauty
joined to goodness occurs in <cite>Henry VIII.</cite> (act ii. sc. 3, lines 60
and 75, vol. vi. pp. 45, 46); it is in the soliloquy or <em>aside</em> speech
of the Lord Chamberlain, who had been saying to Anne
Bullen,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>“The king’s majesty</div>
      <div class='line'>Commends his good opinion of you, and</div>
      <div class='line'>Does purpose honour to you no less flowing</div>
      <div class='line'>Than Marchioness of Pembroke.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>With perfect tact Anne meets the flowing honours, and says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span>“Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,</div>
      <div class='line'>As from a blushing handmaid to his highness,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose health and royalty I pray for.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In an <em>aside</em> the Chamberlain owns,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>“I have perused her well;</div>
      <div class='line'>Beauty and honour in her are so mingled</div>
      <div class='line'>That they have caught the king: and who knows yet</div>
      <div class='line'>But from this lady may proceed a gem</div>
      <div class='line'>To lighten all this isle?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>So on Romeo’s first sight of Juliet <cite>(Romeo and Juliet</cite>, act i.
sc. 5, l. 41, vol. vii. p. 30), her beauty and inner worth called
forth the confession,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!</div>
      <div class='line'>It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope’s ear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And the Sonnet (CV. vol. ix. p. 603, l. 4) that represents love,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Still constant in a wondrous excellence;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>also tells us of the abiding beauty of the soul,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Fair, kind, and true,’ is all my argument,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Fair, kind, and true,’ varying to other words;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in this change is my invention spent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Fair, kind, and true,’ have often lived alone,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which three till now never kept seat in one.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The power of Conscience, as the soul’s bulwark against
adversities, has been sung from the time when Horace wrote
(<cite>Epist.</cite> i. 1. 60),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“This be thy wall of brass, to be conscious to thyself of no shame, to
become pale at no crime.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Or, in the still more popular ode (<em>Carm.</em> i. 22), which being of
old recited in the palaces of Mæcenas and Augustus at Rome,
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span>has, after the flow of nearly nineteen centuries, been revived in
the drawing rooms of Paris and London, and of the whole
civilized world;—</p>

<p class='c000'>Both these sentiments of the lyric poet have been imitated or
adapted by the dramatic; as in <cite>2 Henry VI.</cite> (act iii. sc. 2, l. 232,

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span>Several of the Emblem writers, however, propound a sentiment
not so generally known, in which Apollo’s favourite tree,
the Laurel, is the token of a soul unalarmed by threatening evils.
Sambucus and Whitney so consider it, and illustrate it with the
motto,—<em>The pure conscience is man’s laurel tree.</em></p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The saying rests on the ancient persuasion that the laurel is
the sign of joy, victory and safety, and that it is never struck
even by the bolts of Jove. Sambucus, personifying the laurel,
celebrates its praise in sixteen elegiac lines beginning,—</p>

rehearses to the old theme, <em>A brazen wall, a sound conscience</em>

</div>

<p class='c000'>But a much fuller agreement with the above motto does Whitney
express in the last stanza of Emblem 32,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A conscience cleare, is like a wall of brasse,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>For after guilte, thine inwarde greifes beginne.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The same property is assigned to the Laurel by Joachim
Camerarius (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Ex Re Herbaria</span>,”</span> p. 35, edition 1590). He
quotes several authorities, or opinions for supposing that the
laurel was not injured by lightning. Pliny, he says, supported
the notion; the Emperor Tiberius in thunder storms
betook himself to the shelter of the laurel; and Augustus
before him did the same thing, adding as a further protection
a girdle made from the skin of a sea-calf. Our
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>modern authorities give no countenance to either of these
fancies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, combining the thoughts on Conscience presented by
the Emblems on the subject which have been quoted, can we
fail to perceive in Shakespeare, when he speaks of Conscience
and its qualities, a general agreement with Sambucus, and more
especially with Whitney?</p>

<p class='c000'>And, on the other hand, the stings of Conscience, the deep
remorse for iniquities, the self-condemnation which lights upon
the sinful, never had expounder so forcible and true to nature.
When Alonso, as portrayed in the <cite>Tempest</cite> (act iii. sc. 3, l. 95,

Prospero, he says,—</p>

      <div class='line'>“Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In some degree allied to the power of conscience is the
retribution for sin ordained by the Divine Wisdom. We have
not an Emblem to present in illustration, but the lines from
<cite>King Lear</cite> (act v. sc. 3. l. 171, vol. viii. p. 416),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>are so co-incident with a sentiment in the <cite>Confessions</cite> (bk. i. c.
12, § 19) of the great Augustine that they deserve at least to
be set in juxta-position. The Bishop is addressing the Supreme
in prayer, and naming the sins and follies of his youth, says,—</p>

<p class='c018'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>De peccanti meipso justè retribuebas mihi.</em> <span class='sc'>Jusisti</span> <em>enim, &amp; sic est, ut
pœna sua sibi sit omnis inordinatus animis.</em>”</span></p>

<p class='c019'><em>i.e.</em> “By my own sin Thou didst justly punish me. For thou hast commanded,
and so it is, that every inordinate affection should bear its own punishment.”<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c015'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“<cite>Timon of Athens</cite>,” we are informed by Dr. Drake (vol. ii. p.
447), “is an admirable satire on the folly and ingratitude of
mankind; the former exemplified in the thoughtless profusion
of Timon, the latter in the conduct of his pretended friends; it
is, as Dr. Johnson observes,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘A very powerful warning against that ostentatious liberality, which
scatters bounty, but confers no benefits, and buys flattery but not
friendship.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is some doubt whether Shakespeare derived his idea
of this play from the notices of Timon which appear in Lucian,
or from those given by Plutarch. The fact, however, that the
very excellent work by Sir Thomas North, Knight, <cite>The Lives
of the Noble Grecians and Romaines, &amp;c.</cite>, was published in 1579,—and
that Shakespeare copies it very closely in the account of
Timon’s sepulchre and epitaph, show, I think, Plutarch to have
been the source of his knowledge of Timon’s character and
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the Emblem writers, Sambucus, treated of the same
subject in eighteen Latin elegiacs, and expressly named it,
<cite>Timon the Misanthrope</cite>. The scene, too, which the device
represents, is in a garden, and we can very readily fancy that

<p class='c000'>The character here sketched is deficient in the thorough
heartiness of hatred for which Shakespeare’s Timon is distinguished,
yet may it have served him for the primal material
out of which to create the drama. In Sambucus there is a
mistiness of thought and language which might be said almost
to prefigure the doubtful utterances of some of our modern
philosophers, but in Shakespeare the master himself takes in
hand the pencil of true genius, and by the contrasts and
harmonies, the unmistakeable delineations and portraitures, lays
on the canvas a picture as rich in its colouring as it is constant
in its fidelity to nature, and as perfect in its finish as it is bold
in its conceptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>That epitaph as given by Shakespeare, from North’s <cite>Plutarch</cite>

<p class='c000'>The epitaph of the drama (<cite>Timon of Athens</cite>, act v. sc. 4, l. 69,
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span>vol. vii. p. 305) is thus read by Alcibiades from the wax impression

      <div class='line'>Pass by and curse thy fill: but pass and stay not here thy gait.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Plutarch<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c015'><sup>[175]</sup></a> introduces a mention of Timon into the life of
Marc Antony, whom he compares in some respects to the
misanthrope of Athens. He gives the same epitaph as that of
the Anthology above quoted, except a letter or two,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ἐνθαδ’ ἀποῤῥήξας ψυχὴν βαρυδαίμονα κεῖμαι,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Plutarch avers, “καὶ τοὺτο μὲν αὐτὸν ἔτιζῶντα πεποιηκέναι λέγουσι,”—“And
people say that during his life he himself made this
epitaph.” The narrator then adds, “τοὺτο δε περιφερόμενον,
Καλλιμάχου εστι,”—“But this round the margin is by Callimachus,”—</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The two epitaphs Shakespeare has combined into one,
showing indeed his acquaintance with the above passage
through North’s <cite>Plutarch</cite>, but not discriminating the authorship
of the two parts. North’s translation of the epitaphs is simple
and expressive, but the Langhornes, in 1770, vulgarise the lines
into,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“At last I’ve bid the knaves farewell</div>
      <div class='line'>Ask not my name, but go to hell.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span>“My name is Timon: knaves begone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Curse me, but come not near my stone.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How Wrangham, in his edition of the Langhornes, 1826, could
without notice let this pass for a translation, is altogether unaccountable!</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare’s, adapted as it is by Sir Thomas North in 1612,
may certainly be regarded as a direct version from the Greek,
and might reasonably be adduced to prove that he possessed
some knowledge of that language. Probably, however, he
collected, as he could, the general particulars respecting the
veritable and historical Timon, and obtained the help of some
man of learning so as to give the very epitaph which in the
time of the Peloponnesian war had been placed on the thorn-surrounded
sepulchre of the Athenian misanthrope.</p>

<p class='c000'>To conclude this notice we may observe that the breaking of
the legs, which Sambucus mentions, is said to have been the
actual cause of the real Timon’s death; for that in his hatred of
mankind he even hated himself, and would not allow a surgeon
to attempt his cure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Envy and Hatred may be considered as nearly allied, the
latter too often springing from the former. Alciat, in his 71st
Emblem, gives a brief description of Envy,—</p>

<p class='c000'>The wrong done to the soul, through denying it at the

is set forth with true Shakespearean power in Holbein’s
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Simulachres &amp; Historiees faces de la Mort</cite></span> (Lyons, 1538), on

<p class='c000'>The gallant ship, courageously handled and with high soul of
perseverance and fearlessness guided through adverse waves, has
for long ages been the type of brave men and brave women
struggling against difficulties, or of states and nations amid
opposing influences battling for deliverance and victory. Even
if that gallant ship fails in her voyage she becomes a fitting
type, how “human affairs may decline at their highest.” So

<p class='c000'>Note, now, how the thoughts of the Emblematists, though
greatly excelled in the language which clothes them, are matched
by the avowals which the severe and grave Angelo made to
himself in <cite>Measure for Measure</cite> (act ii. sc. 4, l. 1, vol. i. p. 327).
He had been disposed to carry out against another the full
severity of the law, which he now felt himself inclined to infringe,
but confesses,—</p>

      <div class='line'>And in my heart the strong and swelling evil</div>
      <div class='line'>Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is like a good thing, being often read,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grown fear’d and tedious; yea, my gravity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherein—let no man hear me—I take pride,</div>

<p class='c000'>But the entire force of this parallelism in thought is scarcely
to be apprehended, unless we mark Angelo’s previous conflict of
desire and judgment. Isabel utters the wish, “Heaven keep
your honour safe!” And after a hearty “Amen,” the old man

1555, entitled “Iron,” “on the misery of the human lot,” is
to a very great degree his own, and which makes it appear in a

by a few brief lines,—</p>

French stanzas,—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In various instances, only with greater strength and beauty,
Shakespeare gives utterance to the same sequences of thought.
When, in <cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite> (act i. sc. 1, l. 1, vol. ii. p. 97),
fashioning his court to be,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in25'>“A little Academe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still and contemplative in living art,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Ferdinand, king of Navarre, proclaims,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let Fame, that all hunt after in their lives,</div>
      <div class='line'>Live register’d upon our brazen tombs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then grace us in the disgrace of death;</div>
      <div class='line'>When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,</div>
      <div class='line'>The endeavour of this present breath may buy</div>
      <div class='line'>That honour which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make us heirs of all eternity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='445' id='Page_445'></span>In his Sonnets, more especially, Shakespeare celebrates the
enduring glory of the mind’s treasures. Thus, the 55th Sonnet
(<cite>Works</cite>, vol. ix. p. 578) is written almost as Whitney wrote,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Not marble, nor the gilded monuments</div>
      <div class='line'>Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;</div>
      <div class='line'>But you shall shine more bright in these contents,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than unswept stone, besmear’d with sluttish lime.</div>
      <div class='line'>When wasteful war shall statues overturn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And broils root out the work of masonry.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor Mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn</div>
      <div class='line'>The living record of your memory.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even in the eyes of all posterity</div>
      <div class='line'>That wear this world out to the ending doom.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So, till the judgment that yourself arise,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But the 65th Sonnet (p. 583) is still more in accordance with
Whitney’s ideas,—not a transcript of them, but an appropriation,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>But sad mortality o’ersways their power,</div>
      <div class='line'>How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose action is no stronger than a flower?</div>
      <div class='line'>O how shall summer’s honey breath hold out</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the wreckful siege of battering days,</div>
      <div class='line'>When rocks impregnable are not so stout,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?</div>
      <div class='line'>O fearful meditation! where, alack!</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>No one, unless this miracle have might,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That in black ink my love may still shine bright.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>How closely, too, are these thoughts allied to some in that
Emblem (p. 197) in which Whitney, following Hadrian Junius,
so well celebrates “the eternal glory of the pen.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<span class='sc'>Ex malo bonum</span>,”</span>—<em>Good out of evil</em>,— contains a sentiment
which Shakespeare not unfrequently expresses. An instance
occurs in the <cite>Midsummer Nights Dream</cite> (act i. sc. 1,

<p class='c000'>Also more plainly in <cite>Henry V.</cite> (act iv. sc. 1, l. 3, vol. iv.

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span>As we have mentioned before (pp. 242, 3), Ovid’s <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>
are the chief source to which, from his time downwards,
poets in general have applied for their most imaginative and
popular mythic illustrations; and to him especially have Emblem
writers been indebted. For a fact so well known a single
instance will suffice; it is the description of Chaos and of the
Creation of the World (bk. i. fab. 1),—</p>

appropriateness compare Shakespeare’s noble commendation
of order and good government, into which, by way of contrast,
he introduces the evils and miseries of lawless power.
The argument is assigned to Ulysses, in the <cite>Troilus and
Cressida</cite> (act i. sc. 3, l. 75, vol. vi. p. 144), when the great
chieftains, Agamemnon, Nestor, Menelaus, and others are
discussing the state and prospects of their Grecian confederacy
against Troy. With great force of reasoning, as
of eloquence, he contends,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span>The specialty of rule hath been neglected:</div>

      <div class='line'>When that the general is not like the hive,</div>
      <div class='line'>To whom the foragers shall all repair,</div>
      <div class='line'>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</div>

      <div class='line'>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</div>
      <div class='line'>The unity and married calm of states</div>
      <div class='line'>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is the ladder to all high designs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,</div>
      <div class='line'>Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,</div>
      <div class='line'>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</div>

      <div class='line'>But by degree, stand in authentic place?</div>
      <div class='line'>Take but degree away, untune that string,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets</div>

      <div class='line'>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make a sop of all this solid globe:</div>
      <div class='line'>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the rude son should strike his father dead:</div>
      <div class='line'>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,</div>
      <div class='line'>Between whose endless jar justice resides,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then everything includes itself in power,</div>
      <div class='line'>Power into will, will into appetite;</div>
      <div class='line'>And appetite, an universal wolf.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span>So doubly seconded with will and power,</div>
      <div class='line'>Must make perforce an universal prey,</div>
      <div class='line'>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</div>
      <div class='line'>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Follows the choking.</div>
      <div class='line'>And this neglection of degree it is</div>
      <div class='line'>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</div>
      <div class='line'>It hath to climb. The general’s disdain’d</div>
      <div class='line'>By him one step below; he, by the next;</div>
      <div class='line'>That next by him beneath: so every step,</div>
      <div class='line'>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</div>
      <div class='line'>Of pale and bloodless emulation:</div>
      <div class='line'>And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</div>
      <div class='line'>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>At a hasty glance the two passages may appear to have
little more connection than that of similarity of subject,
leading to several coincidences of expression; but the Emblem
of Chaos, given by Whitney, represents the winds,
the waters, the stars of heaven, all in confusion mingling,
and certainly is very suggestive of the exact words which
the dramatic poet uses,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What raging of the sea? shaking of earth?</div>

      <div class='line'>And make a sop of all this solid globe.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Discord as one of the great causes of confusion is also
spoken of with much force (<cite>1 Henry VI</cite>., act iv. sc. 1,

<p class='c000'>The question is asked, “How do they represent the death or
end of man?” Thus answered,—“To intimate the end of man
they paint a spindle, and the end of the thread cut off, as if

<p class='c000'>Of the Emblems which depict moral qualities and æsthetical

denotes an abiding sense of injury. This we can trace through
Whitney (p. 183) to the French of Claude Paradin (fol. 160), and
to the Italian of Gabriel Symeoni (p. 24). It is a sculptor, with
mallet and chisel, cutting a memorial of his wrongs into a block
<span class='pageno' title='457' id='Page_457'></span>of marble; the title, <cite>Of offended Poverty</cite>, and the motto, “Being

</div>

<p class='c000'>The word here propounded is of very high antiquity. The
prophet Jeremiah (xvii. 1 and 13) set forth most forcibly what
Shakespeare names “men’s evil manners living in brass;” and
Whitney, “harms graven in marble hard.” “The sin of Judah
is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond:
it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of
your altars.” And the writing in water, or in the dust, is in the
very spirit of the declaration, “They that depart from me shall
be written in the earth,”—<em>i.e.</em>, the first wind that blows over them
shall efface their names,—“because they have forsaken the
<span class='sc'>Lord</span>, the fountain of living waters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of Shakespeare’s expressions,—some of the turns of
thought, when he is speaking of injuries,—are so similar to those
used by the Emblem writers in treating of the same subject, that
we reasonably conclude “the famous Scenicke Poet, Master W.
Shakespeare,” was intimate with their works, or with the work of
<span class='pageno' title='459' id='Page_459'></span>some one out of their number; and, as will appear in a page
or two, very probably those expressions and turns of thought
had their origin in the reading of Whitney’s <cite>Choice of Emblemes</cite>
rather than in the study of the French and Italian authors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the same cast of idea with the lines illustrative of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Scribit
in marmore læsus</em></span>, are the words of Marc Antony’s oration over
Cæsar (<cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>, act iii. sc. 2, l. 73, vol. vii. p. 375),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.</div>
      <div class='line'>The evil that men do lives after them;</div>
      <div class='line'>The good is oft interred with their bones;</div>
      <div class='line'>So let it be with Cæsar.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A sentiment, almost the converse of this, and of higher moral
excellence, crops out where certainly we should not expect to
find it—in the <cite>Timon of Athens</cite> (act iii. sc. 5, l. 31, vol. vii. p. 254),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He’s truly valiant that can wisely suffer</div>
      <div class='line'>The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs</div>
      <div class='line'>His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ne’er prefer his injuries to his heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>To bring it into danger.</div>
      <div class='line'>If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,</div>
      <div class='line'>What folly ’tis to hazard life for ill!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In that scene of unparalleled beauty, tenderness, and simplicity,
in which there is related to Queen Katharine the death of
“the great child of honour,” as she terms him, Cardinal Wolsey
(<cite>Henry VIII.</cite>, act iv. sc. 2, l. 27, vol. vi. p. 87), Griffith describes
him as,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>“Full of repentance,</div>
      <div class='line'>Continual meditations, tears and sorrows,</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave his honours to the world again,</div>
      <div class='line'>His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And just afterwards (l. 44), when the Queen had been speaking
with some asperity of the Cardinal’s greater faults, Griffith remonstrates,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>“Noble Madam,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='460' id='Page_460'></span>How very like to the sentiment here enunciated is that of

      <div class='line'>“In marble harde our harmes wee alwayes graue,</div>

<p class='c000'>Lavinia’s deep wrongs (<cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>, act iv. sc. 1, l. 85,

Marcus and Titus what they were and who had inflicted them;
and Marcus declares,—</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There is enough written upon this earth</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Marcus is for instant revenge, but Titus knows the power and
cruel nature of their enemies, and counsels (l. 102),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let alone;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass.</div>
      <div class='line'>And with a gad of steel will write these words,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lay it by: the angry northern wind</div>
      <div class='line'>Will blow these sands, like Sibyl’s leaves, abroad.</div>
      <div class='line'>And where’s your lesson then?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Italian and French Emblems as pictures to be looked at
would readily supply Shakespeare with thoughts respecting the
record of “men’s evil manners,” and of “their virtues,” but
there is a closer correspondence between him and Whitney;
and allowing for the easy substitution of “brass” and of “water”
for “marble” and “dust,” the parallelism of the ideas and words
is so exact as to be only just short of being complete.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must not, however, conceal what may have been a
common origin of the sentiment for all the four writers,—for
the three Emblematists and for the dramatist, namely, a sentence
written by Sir Thomas More, about the year 1516, before
<span class='pageno' title='461' id='Page_461'></span>even Alciatus had published his book of Emblems. Dr. Percy,
as quoted by Ayscough (p. 695), remarks that, “This reflection
bears a great resemblance to a passage in Sir Thomas More’s
<cite>History of Richard III.</cite>, where, speaking of the ungrateful turns
which Jane Shore experienced from those whom she had served
in her prosperity, More adds, ‘Men use, if they have an evil
turne, to write it in marble, and whoso doth us a good turne, we
write it in duste.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the thought is recorded as passing through the mind of
Columbus, when, during mutiny, sickness, and cruel tidings from
home, he had, on the coast of Panama, the vision which Irving
describes and records. A voice had been reproving him, but
ended by saying, “Fear not, Columbus, all these tribulations
are written in marble, and are not without cause.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To write in dust,” however, has sometimes a simple literal
meaning in Shakespeare; as when King Edward (<cite>3 Henry VI.</cite>,
act v. sc. 1, l. 54, vol. v. p. 319), uses the threat,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall, while thy head is warm and new cut off,</div>
      <div class='line'>Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But in the <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> (act iii. sc. 1, l. 12, vol. vi. p. 472),
the phrase is of doubtful meaning: it may denote the oblivion
of injuries or the deepest of sorrows,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“In the dust I write</div>
      <div class='line'>My heart’s deep languor, and my soul’s sad tears.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whitney also has the lines to the praise of Stephen Limbert,
Master of Norwich School (p. 173),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our writing in the duste, can not indure a blaste;</div>
      <div class='line'>But that which is in marble wroughte, from age to age, doth laste.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is but justice to Shakespeare to testify that at times his
judgment respecting injuries rises to the full height of Christian
<span class='pageno' title='462' id='Page_462'></span>morals. The spirit Ariel avows, that, were he human, his “affections
would become tender” towards the shipwrecked captives
on whom his charms had been working (<cite>Tempest</cite>, act v. sc. 1,
l. 21, vol. i. p. 64); and Prospero enters into his thought with
strong conviction,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling</div>
      <div class='line'>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</div>
      <div class='line'>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,</div>
      <div class='line'>Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?</div>
      <div class='line'>Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury</div>
      <div class='line'>Do I take part: the rarer action is</div>
      <div class='line'>In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</div>
      <div class='line'>Not a frown further.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The subject in this connection finds a fitting conclusion
from the words of a later writer, communicated to me by the
Rev. T. Walker, M.A., formerly of Nether Tabley, in which a
free forgiveness of injuries is ascribed to the world’s great and
blessed Saviour,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Some write their wrongs on marble, He more just</div>
      <div class='line'>Stoop’d down serene, and wrote them in the dust,</div>
      <div class='line'>Trod under foot, the sport of every wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Swept from the earth, quite banished from his mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>There secret in the grave He bade them lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And grieved, they could not ’scape the Almighty’s eye.”</div>
    </div>

Emblems Miscellaneous will include
some which have been omitted, or which
remain unclassified from not belonging
to any of the foregoing divisions. They
are placed here without any attempt to
bring them into any special order.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several words and forms of thought
employed by the Emblem writers, and especially by Whitney,
have counterparts, if not direct imitations, in Shakespeare’s
dramas; he often treats of the same heroes in the same way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, in reference to Paris and Helen, Whitney utters his
opinion respecting them (p. 79),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thoughe <span class='sc'>Paris</span>, had his <span class='sc'>Helen</span> at his will,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thinke howe his faite, was <span class='sc'>Ilions</span> foule deface.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Shakespeare sets forth Troilus (<cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite>, act ii.
sc. 2, l. 81, vol. vi. p. 164) as saying of Helen,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in21'>“Why, she is a pearl,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose price hath launch’d above a thousand ships,</div>
      <div class='line'>And turn’d crown’d kings to merchants.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And then, as adding (l. 92),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in23'>“O, theft most base,</div>
      <div class='line'>That we have stol’n what we do fear to keep!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span>But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n.</div>
      <div class='line'>That in their country did them that disgrace,</div>
      <div class='line'>We fear to warrant in our native place!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whitney inscribes a frontispiece or dedication of his work
with the letters, D. O. M.,—<em>i.e.</em>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Deo, Optimo, Maximo</em></span>,—“To God,
best, greatest,”—and writes,—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>D. O. M.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Very similar sentiments are enunciated in several of the
dramas; as in <cite>Twelfth Night</cite> (act iii. sc. 4, l. 340, vol. iii. p. 285),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“Taint of vice, whose strong corruption</div>
      <div class='line'>Inhabits our frail blood.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Henry VIII.</cite> (act v. sc. 3, l. 10, vol. vi. p. 103), the Lord
Chancellor says to Cranmer,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“But we all are men,</div>
      <div class='line'>In our own nature frail and capable</div>
      <div class='line'>Of our flesh; few are angels.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Even Banquo (<cite>Macbeth</cite>, act ii. sc. 1, l. 7, vol. vii. P. 444) can utter
the prayer,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“Merciful powers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature</div>
      <div class='line'>Gives way to in repose!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And very graphically does Richard III. (act iv. sc. 2, l. 65,
vol. v. p. 583) describe our sinfulness as prompting sin,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in27'>“But I am in</div>
      <div class='line'>So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Or as Romeo puts the case (<cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, act v. sc. 3, l. 61,
vol. vii. p. 124),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'><span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span>“I beseech thee, youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Put not another sin upon my head,</div>
      <div class='line'>By urging me to fury.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Coriolanus thus speaks of man’s “unstable lightness” (<cite>Coriolanus</cite>,
act iii. sc. 1, l. 160, vol. vi. p. 344),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Not having the power to do the good it would,</div>
      <div class='line'>For the ill which doth control ’t.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Human dependence upon God’s blessing is well expressed by
the conqueror at Agincourt (<cite>Henry V.</cite>, act iv. sc. 7, l. 82,
vol. iv. p. 582),—“Praised be God, and not our strength, for it;”
and (act iv. sc. 8, l. 100),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“O God, thy arm was here!</div>
      <div class='line'>And not to us, but to thy arm alone</div>
      <div class='line'>Ascribe we all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And simply yet truly does the Bishop of Carlisle point out that
dependence to Richard II. (act iii. sc. 2, l. 29, vol. iv. p. 164),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The means that heaven yields must be embraced,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not neglected; else, if heaven would,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we will not, heaven’s offer we refuse,</div>
      <div class='line'>The proffer’d means of succour and redress.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The closing thought of Whitney’s whole passage is embodied
in Wolsey’s earnest charge to Cromwell (<cite>Henry VIII.</cite>, act iii.
sc. 2, l. 446, vol. vi. p. 79),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“Be just, and fear not:</div>
      <div class='line'>Let all the ends thou aim’st at be thy country’s,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy God’s, and truth’s; then if thou fall’st, O Cromwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou fall’st a blessed martyr!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The various methods of treating the very same subject by
the professed Emblem writers will prove that, even with a full
knowledge of their works, a later author may yet allow scarcely
a hint to escape him, that he was acquainted, in some particular
instance, with the sentiments and expressions of his predecessors;
<span class='pageno' title='466' id='Page_466'></span>indeed, that knowledge itself may give birth to thoughts widely
different in their general character. To establish this position
we offer a certain proverb which both Sambucus and Whitney
adopt, the almost paradoxical saying, <em>We flee the things which
we follow, and they flee us</em>,—</p>

<div class='illo'>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span>In both instances there is exactly the same pictorial illustration,
indeed the wood-block which was engraved for the
Emblems of Sambucus, in 1564, with simply a change of border,
did service for Whitney’s Emblems in 1586. The device
contains Time, winged and flying and holding forward a scythe;
a man and woman walking before him, the scythe being held
over their heads threateningly,—the man as he advances turning
half round and pointing to a treasure-box left behind. Sambucus
thus moralizes,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What do we querulous always deem our want?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why never to hunger sense of fulness grant?</div>
      <div class='line'>Wealth flees us not,—but we accustomed are</div>
      <div class='line'>By our own haste its benefits to mar.</div>
      <div class='line'>Death takes us off before we reach the gain</div>
      <div class='line'>Great as our wish; and vows to God we feign</div>
      <div class='line'>For wealth which fleeing at the time we flee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even when wealth around we own to be.</div>
      <div class='line'>O let not riches prove thy spirit’s bane!</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor shall thou seek for happiness in vain,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Though rough thy paths of life on every hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Firm on its base thy truest bliss shall stand.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now Whitney adopts, in part at least, a much more literal
interpretation; he follows out what the figure of Time and the
accessory figures suggest, and so improves his proverb-text as to
found upon it what appears pretty plainly to have been the
groundwork of the ancient song,—“The old English gentleman,
one of the olden time.” The type of that truly venerable character
was “<span class='sc'>Thomas Wilbraham</span> <em>Esquier</em>,” an early patron
of Lord Chancellor Egerton. Whitney’s lines are (p. 199),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wee flee, from that wee seeke; &amp; followe, that wee leaue:</div>
      <div class='line'>And, whilst wee thinke our webbe to skante, &amp; larger still would weaue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lo, Time dothe cut vs of, amid our carke: and care.</div>
      <div class='line'>Which warneth all, that haue enoughe, and not contented are.</div>
      <div class='line'>For to inioye their goodes, their howses, and their landes:</div>
      <div class='line'>Bicause the Lorde vnto that end, commits them to their handes.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span>Yet, those whose greedie mindes: enoughe, doe thinke too small:</div>
      <div class='line'>Whilst that with care they seeke for more, oft times are reu’d of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherefore all such (I wishe) that spare, where is no neede:</div>
      <div class='line'>To vse their goodes whilst that they may, for time apace doth speede.</div>
      <div class='line'>And since, by proofe I knowe, you hourde not vp your store;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose gate, is open to your frende: and purce, vnto the pore:</div>
      <div class='line'>And spend vnto your praise, what <span class='sc'>God</span> dothe largely lende:</div>
      <div class='line'>I chiefly made my choice of this, which I to you commende.</div>
      <div class='line'>In hope, all those that see your name, aboue the head:</div>
      <div class='line'>Will at your lampe, their owne come light, within your steppes to tread.</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose daily studie is, your countrie to adorne:</div>
      <div class='line'>And for to keepe a worthie house, in place where you weare borne.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the spirit of one part of these stanzas is a question in
Philemon Holland’s <cite>Plutarch</cite> (p. 5). “What meane you, my
masters, and whither run you headlong, carking and caring all
that ever you can to gather goods and rake riches together?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Similar in its meaning to the two Emblems just considered
is another by Whitney (p. 218), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Mulier vmbra viri</em></span>,—“Woman
the shadow of man,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ovr shadowe flies, if wee the same pursue:</div>
      <div class='line'>But if wee flie, it followeth at the heele.</div>
      <div class='line'>So, he throughe loue that moste dothe serue, and sue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is furthest off his mistresse harte is steele.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But if hee flie, and turne awaie his face,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Shee followeth straight, and grones to him for grace.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This Emblem is very closely followed in the <cite>Merry Wives of
Windsor</cite> (act ii. sc. 2, l. 187, vol. i. p. 196), when Ford, in
disguise as “Master Brook,” protests to Falstaff that he had
followed Mrs. Ford “with a doting observance;” “briefly,” he
says, “I have pursued her as love hath pursued me; which hath
been on the wing of all occasions,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Death in most of its aspects is described and spoken of by
the great Dramatist, and possibly we might hunt out some
<span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span>expressions of his which coincide with those of the Emblem
writers on the same subject, but generally his mention of death
is peculiarly his own,—as when Mortimer says (<cite>1 Henry VI.</cite>,

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In his beautiful edition of Holbein’s <cite>Dance of Death</cite>, Noel
Humphreys (p. 81), in describing the <span class='sc'>Canoness</span>, thus conjectures,—“May
not Shakespeare
have had this device
in his mind when penning
the passage in which
Othello” (act v. sc. 2, l. 7,
vol. viii. p. 574), “determining
to kill Desdemona,
exclaims, ‘Put out the
light—and then—put out
the light?’”</p>

<p class='c000'>The way, however, in
which Shakespeare sometimes
speaks of Death and
Sleep induces the supposition
that he was acquainted
with those passages in
Holbein’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Simulachres de la Mort</cite></span> (Lyons, 1538) which treat of
the same subjects by the same method. Thus,—</p>

<p class='c018'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Cicero disoit bien: Tu as le sommeil pour imaige de la Mort, &amp; tous
les iours tu ten reuestz. Et si doubtes, sil y à nul sentiment a la Mort,
combien que tu voyes qu’ en son simulachre il n’y à nul sentimẽt.”</span> Sign. Liij
<em>verso</em>. And again, sign. Liiij <em>verso</em>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“La Mort est le veritable reffuge, la
santé parfaicte, le port asseure, la victoire entiere, la chair sans os, le poisson
sans espine, le grain sans paille.... La Mort est vng eternel sommeil, vne
dissolution du Corps, vng espouuẽtement des riches, vng desir des pouures,
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>vng cas ineuitable, vng pelerinaige incertain, vng larron des hõmes, vne

<p class='c000'>Thus the Prince Henry by his father’s couch, thinking him dead,
says (<cite>2 Hen. IV.</cite>, act iv. sc. 5, l. 35, vol. iv. p. 453),—</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, in that noble soliloquy of Hamlet (act iii. sc. 1, lines 60–69,

  </div>
</div>

<div id='i208'  class='figcenter id042'>
<img src='images/img208.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><cite>Holbein’s Imagines, Cologne, 1566.</cite></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To another of the devices of the <cite>Images of Death</cite> (Lyons,
1547), attributed to Holbein, we may also refer as the source
of one of the Dramatist’s descriptions, in Douce’s <cite>Dance of Death</cite>,
(London, 1833, and Bonn’s, 1858); the device in question is
numbered XLIII. and bears the title of the <span class='sc'>Idiot Fool</span>. Woltmann’s
<cite>Holbein and his Time</cite> (Leipzig, 1868, vol. ii. p. 121),
names the figure “<span class="blackletter">Narr des Todes</span>,”—<cite>Death’s Fool</cite>,—and thus
discourses respecting it. “Among the supplemental Figures,”—that
is to say, in the edition of 1545, supplemental to the <em>forty-one</em>
Figures in the edition of 1538,—“is found that of the Fool, which
formerly in the Spectacle-plays of the <cite>Dance of Death</cite> represented
by living persons played an important part. Also as
these were no longer wont to be exhibited, the Episode of the
contest of Death with the Fool was kept separate, and for the
diversion of the people became a pantomimic representation.
<span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>From England expressly have we information that this usage
maintained itself down to the former century. The Fool’s efforts
and evasions in order to escape from Death, who in the end
became his master, form the subject of the particular figures.
On such representations Shakespeare thought in his verses in
<cite>Measure for Measure</cite>” (act iii. sc. 1, lines 6–13, vol. i. p. 334).
Though Woltmann gives only three lines, we add the whole
passage better to bring out the sense,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>“Reason thus with life:</div>
      <div class='line'>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</div>
      <div class='line'>That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,</div>
      <div class='line'>Servile to all the skyey influences,</div>
      <div class='line'>That dost this habitation, where thou keep’st,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death’s fool;</div>
      <div class='line'>For him thou labour’st by thy flight to shun,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet runn’st toward him still.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The action described by Shakespeare is so conformable to
Holbein’s Figures of Death and the Idiot Fool that, without
<span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span>doing violence to the probability, we may conclude that the two
portraits had been in the Poet’s eye as well as in his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woltmann’s remarks in continuation uphold this idea. He
says (vol. ii. p. 122),—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Also in the Holbein picture the Fool is foolish enough to think that he
can slip away from Death. He springs aside, seeks through his movements
to delude him, and brandishes the leather-club, in order unseen to plant a
blow on his adversary; and this adversary seems in sport to give in, skips
near him, playing on the bag-pipe, but unobserved has him fast by the
garment, in order not again to let him loose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Time is a character introduced by way of Chorus into
the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite> (act iv. sc. 1, l. 7, vol. III. p. 371), and he takes
upon himself “to use his wings,” as he says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“It is in my power</div>
      <div class='line'>To o’erthrow law and in one self-born hour</div>
      <div class='line'>To plant and o’erwhelm custom. Let me pass</div>
      <div class='line'>The same I am, ere ancient’st order was</div>
      <div class='line'>Or what is now received: I witness to</div>
      <div class='line'>The times that brought them in; so shall I do</div>
      <div class='line'>To the freshest things now reigning, and make stale</div>
      <div class='line'>The glistering of this present.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Something of the same paradox which appears in the Emblematist’s
motto, “What we follow we flee,” also distinguishes the
quibbling dialogue about time between Dromio of Syracuse and
Adriana (<cite>Comedy of Errors</cite>, act iv. sc. 2, l. 53, vol. i. p. 437),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Dro. S.</em> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">’Tis time that I were gone:</span></div>
      <div class='line'>It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Adr.</em> The hours come back! that did I never hear.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Dro. S.</em> O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a’turns back for very fear.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Adr.</em> As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Dro. S.</em> Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he’s worth to season.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, he’s a thief too: have you not heard men say,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Time comes stealing on by night and day?</div>
      <div class='line'>If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>Almost of the same complexion are some of the other strong
contrasts of epithets which Shakespeare applies. Iachimo, in
<cite>Cymbeline</cite> (act i. sc. 6, l. 46, vol. ix. p. 185), uses the expressions,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in37'>“The cloyed will,</div>
      <div class='line'>That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub</div>
      <div class='line'>Both fill’d and running, ravening first the lamb,</div>
      <div class='line'>Longs after for the garbage.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But “old fond paradoxes, to make fools laugh i’ the ale-house,”
are also given forth from the storehouse of his conceits.
Desdemona and Emilia and Iago play at these follies (<cite>Othello</cite>,
act ii. sc. 1, l. 129, vol. viii. p. 477), and thus some of them are
uttered,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<em>Iago.</em> If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,</div>
      <div class='line'>The one’s for use, the other useth it.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Des.</em> Well praised! How if she be black and witty?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Iago.</em> If she be black, and thereto have a wit,</div>
      <div class='line'>She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.</div>
      <div class='c011'>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Des.</em> But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed?</div>
      <div class='line'>one that, on the authority of her merit, did justly put on the vouch of very</div>
      <div class='line'>malice itself?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Iago.</em> She that was ever fair, and never proud,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had tongue at will, and yet was never loud.</div>
      <div class='line'>Never lack’d gold, and yet went never gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fled from her wish, and yet said, now I may;</div>
      <div class='c011'>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</div>
      <div class='line'>She was a wight, if ever such wight were,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Des.</em> To do what?</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Iago.</em> To suckle fools, and chronicle small beer.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We thus return, by a wandering path indeed, to the paradoxical
saying with which we set out,—concerning “fleeing
what we follow;” for Iago’s paragon of a woman,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fled from her wish, and yet said, now I may.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Taken by itself, the coincidence of a few words in the dedications
of works by different authors is of trifling importance;
<span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span>but when we notice how brief are the lines in which Shakespeare
commends his “<span class='sc'>Venus and Adonis</span>” to the patronage of the
Earl of Southampton, it is remarkable that he has adopted an
expression almost singular, which Whitney had beforehand
employed in the long dedication of his Emblems to the Earl of
Leycester. “Being abashed,” says Whitney, “that my habillitie
can not affoorde them such, as are fit to be offred vp to so honorable
a suruaighe” (p. xi); and Shakespeare, “I leave it to your
honourable survey, and your Honour to your heart’s content.”
Whitney then declares, “yet if it shall like your honour to
allowe of anie of them, I shall thinke my pen set to the booke
in happie hour; and it shall incourage mee, to assay some
matter of more momente, as soon as leasure will further my
desire in that behalfe;” and Shakespeare, adopting the same
idea, also affirms, “only if your Honour seem but pleased, I
account myself highly praised and vow to take advantage of all
idle hours, till I have honoured you with some graver labour.”
Comparing these passages together, the inference appears not
unwarranted, that Whitney’s dedication had been read by Shakespeare,
and that the tenor of it abided in his memory, and so
was made use of by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the well-known lines of <cite>Horace</cite> (Ode ii. 10),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sæpius ventis agitatur ingens</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>several of the Emblem writers, and Shakespeare after them, tell
of the huge pine and of its contests with the tempests; and how
lofty towers fall with a heavier crash, and how the lightnings
smite the highest mountains. Sambucus (edition 1569, p. 279)
and Whitney (p. 59) do this, as a comment for the injunction,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Nimium rebus ne fide secundis</em></span>,—“Be not too confident in
<span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>prosperity.”  In this instance the stanzas of Whitney serve
well to express the verses of Sambucus,—</p>

<p class='c000'>Antonio, in the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> (act iv. sc. 1, l. 75, vol. ii.

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You may as well forbid the mountain pines</div>

      <div class='line'>When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And when “dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloster’s wife,” is
banished, and her noble husband called on to give up the Lord
<span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span>Protector’s staff of office (<cite>2 Henry VI.</cite>, act ii. sc. 3, l. 45, vol. v.

      <div class='line'>“Thus droops this lofty pine, and hangs his sprays;</div>

<p class='c000'>So, following almost literally the words of Horace, the
exiled Belarius, in <cite>Cymbeline</cite> (act iv. sc. 2, l. 172, vol. ix.
p. 253), declares of the “two princely boys,” that passed

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Words, which, though now obsolete, were in current use in
the days of Surrey, Sidney, Spenser, and Shakespeare, cannot
of themselves be adduced in evidence of any interchange of
ideas; but when the form of the sentence and the application
of some peculiar term agree, we may reasonably presume that
it has been more than the simple use of the same common
tongue which has caused the agreement. When, indeed, one
author writes in English, and the others in Latin, or Italian,
or French, we cannot expect much more than similarity of
idea in treating of the same subject, and a mutual intercommunion
of thought; but, in the case of authors employing
the same mother tongue, there are certain correspondencies
in the use of the same terms and turns of expression which
betoken imitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such correspondencies exist between Whitney and Shakespeare,

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span>So close are some of these correspondencies that they can
scarcely be accounted for except on the theory that Shakespeare
had been an observant reader of Whitney’s Emblems.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are also various expressions, or epithets, which the
Emblem-books may be employed to illustrate, and which
receive their most natural explanation from this same theory
that Shakespeare was one of the very numerous host of
Emblem students or readers. Perriere’s account of a man
attempting to swim with a load of iron on his back
(Emb. 70), is applied by Whitney with direct reference
to the lines in Horace, “O cursed lust of gold, to what
dost thou not compel mortal bosoms?” He sets off the
thought by the device of a man swimming with “a fardle,” or
heavy burden (p. 179),—</p>

<p class='c000'>In the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite>, the word “fardel” occurs several

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c000'>The Bandogs, which Sir Thomas More and Spenser describe,
appear to have been different from those of Sambucus
and Whitney, or, rather, they were employed for a different
purpose. “We must,” writes the worthy Chancellor (p. 586),
“haue bande dogges to dryue them (the swine) out of the corne
with byting, and leade them out by the ears;” and Spenser, in
<cite>Virgil’s Gnat</cite> (l. 539), speaks of—</p>

      <div class='line'>Manie great bandogs, which her gird about.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These dogs were mastiffs, and their banning was barking or
braying; but the dogs entitled bandogs in Whitney, though
also mastiffs, were fastened by a band to a small cart, and
trained to draw it. A large species of dog may be seen at this
day in the towns of Belgium performing the very same service
to which their ancestors had been accustomed above three
centuries ago. Sambucus heads his description of the bandog’s
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span>strength and labours with the sentence,—“ The dog complains
that he is greatly wronged.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The mastiff is almost the only dog to which Shakespeare
assigns any epithet of praise. In <cite>Henry V.</cite> (act iii. sc. 7, l. 130,
vol. iv. p. 552), one of the French lords, Rambures, acknowleges
“that island of England breeds very valiant creatures; their
mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.” It is the same quality in
Achilles and Ajax on which Ulysses and Nestor count when
“the old man eloquent,” in <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> (act i. sc. 3,
l. 391, vol. vi. p. 155), says of the two warriors,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone</div>
      <div class='line'>Must tarre<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c015'><sup>[184]</sup></a> the mastiffs on, as ’twere their bone.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span>It is, however, only in a passing allusion that Shakespeare
introduces any mention of the bandog. He is describing the
night “when Troy was set on fire” (<cite>2 Henry VI.</cite>, act i. sc. 4,
l. 16, vol. v. p. 129), and thus speaks of it,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The time when scritch-owls cry, and ban-dogs howl,</div>
      <div class='line'>When spirits walk, and ghosts break up their graves.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We are all familiar with the expression “motley’s the only
wear,” and probably we are disposed simply to refer it to the
way in which that important personage was arrayed who
exercised his fun and nonsense and shrewd wit in the courts of
the kings and in the mansions of the nobles of the middle ages.
The pictorial type exists in the Emblems both of Sambucus and
of his copyist Whitney (p. 81), by whom the sage advice is
imparted,—“Give trifles in charge to fools.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prologue to <cite>Henry VIII.</cite> (l. 15) alludes to the dress of

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The fool in <cite>King Lear</cite> (act i. sc. 4, 1. 93, vol. viii. p. 280)
seems to have been dressed according to Whitney’s pattern, for,
on giving his cap to Kent, he says,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.</p>

<p class='c018'><em>Kent.</em> Why, fool?</p>

<p class='c018'><em>Fool.</em> Why, for taking one’s part that’s out of favour: nay, an thou canst
not smile as the wind sits, thou’lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:
why, this fellow hath banished two on’s daughters, and done the

to us a pretty accurate idea of the fool’s attire,—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Well geue him cloth and let the fool</div>

<p class='c000'>Perchance we know the lines in the “<span class='sc'>Faerie Queene</span>” (vi.
c. 7, 49, 1. 6),—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“And other whiles with bitter mockes and mowes</div>

      <div class='line'>Words sharpely wound, but greatest griefe of scorning growes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But probably we are not prepared to trace some of the expressions
in these lines to an Emblem-book origin. The graphic
“mockes and mowes,” indeed, no Latin nor French can express;
but our old friend Paradin, in the “<span class='sc'>Devises Heroiqves</span>”
(leaf 174), names an occasion on which very amusing “mockes
and mowes” were exhibited; it was, moreover, an example
that,—</p>

<p class='c018'>“<em>Things badly obtained are badly scattered.</em>” As he narrates the tale,—
“One day it happened that a huge ape, nourished in the house of a miser
who found pleasure only in his crowns, after seeing through a hole his
master playing with his crowns upon a table, obtained means of entering
within by an open window, while the miser was at dinner. The ape took a
stool, as his master did, but soon began to throw the silver out of the
window into the street. How much the passers by kept laughing and the
miser was vexed, I shall not attempt to say. I will not mock him among
his neighbours who were picking up his bright crowns either for a nestegg,
or for a son or a brother,—for a gamester, a driveller or a drunkard,—for I
cannot but remember that fine and true saying which affirms, ‘<em>Things badly
gained are badly scattered</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>This tale, derived by Paradin from Gabriel Symeoni’s
<cite>Imprese Heroiche et Morali</cite>, is assumed by Whitney as the
groundwork of his very lively narrative (p. 169), <cite>Against
Userers</cite>, of which we venture to give the whole.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A brief <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>resumé</em></span>, or recapitulation, will now place the nature of
our argument more clearly in review.</p>

<p class='c000'>When writing and its kindred arts of designing and colouring
were the only means in use for the making and illustrating of
books, drawings of an emblematical character were frequently
executed both for the ornamenting and for the fuller explanation
of various works.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the origin of printing, books of an emblematical
character, as the <cite>Bibles of the Poor</cite> and other block-books, were
generally known in the civilised portions of Europe; they constituted,
to a considerable degree, the illustrated literature of
their age, and enjoyed wide fame and popularity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not many years after printing with moveable types had been
invented, Emblem works as a distinct species of literature
<span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span>appeared; and of these some of the earliest were soon translated
into English.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is on undoubted record that the use of Emblems, derived
from German, Latin, French, and Italian sources, prevailed in
England for purposes of ornamentation of various kinds; that
the works of Brandt, Giovio, Symeoni, and Paradin were translated
into English; and that there were several English writers
or collectors of Emblems within Shakespeare’s lifetime,—as
Daniell, Whitney, Willet, Combe, and Peacham.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakespeare possessed great artistic powers, so as to appreciate
and graphically describe the beauties and qualities of
excellence in painting, sculpture, and music. His attainments,
too, in the languages enabled him to make use of the Emblem-books
that had been published in Latin, Italian, and French, and
possibly in Spanish.</p>

<p class='c000'>In everything, except in the actual pictorial device, Shakespeare
exhibited himself as a skilled designer,—indeed, a writer
of Emblems; he followed the very methods on which this
species of literary composition was conducted, and needed only
the engraver’s aid to make perfect designs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Freest among mortals were the Emblem writers in borrowing
one from the other, and from any source which might serve
the construction of their ingenious devices; and they generally
did this without acknowledgment. An Emblem once launched
into the world of letters was treated as a fable or a proverb,—it
became for the time and the occasion the property of whoever
chose to take it. In using Emblems, therefore, Shakespeare is
no more to be regarded as a copyist than his contemporaries are,
but simply as one who exercised a recognised right to appropriate
what he needed of the general stock of Emblem notions.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several direct References in Shakespeare, at
least six, in which, by the closest description and by express
quotation, he identifies himself with the Emblem writers who
preceded him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='494' id='Page_494'></span>But besides these direct References, there are several collateral
ones, in which ideas and expressions are employed similar
to those of Emblematists, and which indicate a knowledge of
Emblem art.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, finally, the parallelisms and correspondencies are very
numerous between devices and turns of thought, and even between
the words of the Emblem writers and passages in Shakespeare’s
Sonnets and Dramas; and these receive their most
appropriate <em>rationale</em> on the supposition that they were suggested
to his mind through reading the Emblem-books, or
through familiarity with the Emblem literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, such References and Coincidences are not to be regarded
as purely accidental, neither can all of them be urged
with entire confidence. Some persons even may be disposed to
class them among the similarities which of necessity arise when
writers of genius and learning take up the same themes, and
call to their aid all the resources of their memory and research.</p>

<p class='c000'>I presume not, however, to say that my arguments and
statements are absolute proofs, except in a few instances. What
I maintain is this: that the Emblem writers, and our own Whitney
especially, do supply many curious and highly interesting
illustrations of the Shakespearean dramas, and that several of
them, probably, were in the mind of the Dramatist as he wrote.</p>

<p class='c000'>To show that the theory carried out in these pages is neither
singular nor unsupported by high authorities, it should not be
forgotten that the very celebrated critic, Francis Douce, in his
<cite>Illustrations of Shakespeare</cite> (pp. 302, 392), maintains that Paradin
was the source of the torch-emblem in the <cite>Pericles</cite> (act ii. sc. 2,
l. 32): the “wreath of victory,” and “gold on the touchstone,”
have also the same source. To Holbein’s <cite>Simulachres</cite> Noel
Humphreys assigns the origin of the expression in <cite>Othello</cite>, “Put
out the light—and then, put out the light;” and in the same
work, Dr. Alfred Woltmann, in <cite>Holbein and his Times</cite> (vol. ii.
<span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span>p. 121), finds the origin of Death’s fool in <cite>Measure for Measure</cite>:
and Shakespeare’s comparisons of “Death and Sleep” may be
traced to Jean de Vauzelle, who wrote the Dissertations for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Les
Simulachres</cite></span>. Charles Knight, also, in his <cite>Pictorial Shakspere</cite>
(vol. i. p. 154), to illustrate the lines in <cite>Hamlet</cite> (act iv. sc. 5, l. 142)
respecting “the kind life-rendering pelican,” quotes Whitney’s
stanza, and copies his woodcut, as stated <em>ante</em>, p. 396, note.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though not a learned man, as Erasmus or Beza was, Shakespeare,
as every page of his wonderful writings shows, must have
been a reading man, and well acquainted with the current
literature of his age and country. Whitney’s <cite>Emblemes</cite> were
well known in 1612 to the author of “<span class='sc'>Minerva Britanna</span>,”
and boasted of in 1598 by Thomas Meres, in his <cite>Wit’s Commonwealth</cite>,
as fit to be compared with any of the most eminent
Latin writers of Emblems, and dedicated to many of the distinguished
men of Elizabeth’s reign; and they could scarcely
have been unknown to Shakespeare even had there been no
similarities of thought and expression established between the
two writers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor after the testimonies which have been adduced, and
comparing the picture-emblems submitted for consideration with
the passages from Shakespeare which are their parallels, as far
as words can be to drawings, are we required to treat it as
nothing but a conjecture that Shakespeare, like others of his
countrymen, possessed at least a general acquaintance with the
popular Emblem-books of his own generation and of that which
went before.</p>

<p class='c000'>The study of the old Emblem-books certainly possesses little
of the charm which the unsurpassed natural power of Shakespeare
has infused into his dramas, and which time does not
diminish; yet that study is no barren pursuit for such as will
seek for “virtue’s fair form and graces excellent,” or who desire
to note how the learning of the age disported itself at its hours
of recreation, and how, with few exceptions, it held firm its
<span class='pageno' title='496' id='Page_496'></span>allegiance to purity of thought, and reverenced the spirit of
religion. Should there be any whom these pages incite to gain
a fuller knowledge of the Emblem literature, I would say in the
words of Arthur Bourchier, Whitney’s steady friend,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Goe forwarde then in happie time, and thou shalt surely finde,</em></div>

extensive collection of Emblem-books at Keir, made by the Author of <cite>The Cloister
Life of Charles V.</cite>, Sir William Stirling Maxwell, Bart.; <em>c</em>, in the Library formed by
the Rev. Thomas Corser, Rector of Stand, near Manchester; <em>t</em>, in that of Henry Yates
Thompson, Esq., of Thingwall, near Liverpool.  I have had the opportunity, most
kindly given, of examining very many of the Emblem-works at Keir, and nearly all
of those at Stand and Thingwall.  The three collections contained at the time of
my examination of them 934, 204, and 248 volumes, in the whole 1386 volumes.
Deducting duplicates, the number of distinct editions in the three libraries is above 900.

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r64'>64</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We select an instance common to both Holbein and Shakespeare; it is pointed
out by Woltmann, in his <cite>Holbein and his Time</cite>, vol. ii. p. 23, where, speaking of the
Holbein painting, <cite>The Death of Lucretia</cite>, the writer says,—“The costume is here, as
ever, that of Holbein’s own time. The painter reminds us of Shakespeare, who also
conceived the heroes of classic antiquity in the costume of his own days; in the <cite>Julius
Cæsar</cite> the troops are drawn up by beat of drum, and Coriolanus comes forth like an
English lord: but the historical signification of the subject nevertheless does in a
degree become understood, which the later poetry, with every instrument of
archæological learning, troubles itself in vain to reach.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“In regard to Queen Mary’s bed at Holyrood, there is one which is shown to visitors, but I am
quite satisfied that it does not correspond with Drummond’s description, as ‘wrought in silk and gold.’
There are some hangings of old tapestry, but in a very bad state of preservation. Yesterday afternoon
I went down to take another look at it, but found, as it was getting dark, some of the rooms
locked up, and no person present. Should, however, I find anything further on the subject, I will let

<p class='c000'>The table at the end of this note summarizes any corrections to the text that
have been deemed to be printer’s errors. Proper names have been mostly allowed to
stand as well, given the vagaries of spelling and translation in the originals,
with the exception of Diane of Poi[c]tiers, whose name is consistently spelled
without the ‘c’, save in the one instance noted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The paragraph at the bottom of p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>, beginning with ‘For the nature of Fictile
ornamentation...’ ends with a double quotation mark which is unmatched. It is not
clear where the quotation begins, since the passage seems to be partly paraphrasing.
The quotation has been allowed to stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spelling of the emblem-writer ‘<a href='#coelius'>Cœlius</a>’ in the General Index disagrees with that
given in the table on p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a> as ‘Cælius’.</p>

<p class='c000'>On p. 39, an illustration serves as a border for the text. This has been
approximated here, but, depending on browser settings, may not display
correctly.</p>

<p class='c000'>On p. 289 and p. 418, the ornate dropcap letters for ‘F’ and ‘L’ on the opening lines of
poetry has not been reproduced, but can be seen here.</p>

<p class='c000'>The text makes frequent use of now-obsolete contractions, ligatures, and
scribal abbreviations. <span class="htmlonly">The Greek terminal -os (<span class="htmlonly"><img src="images/os_note.jpg" width="21" height="12" alt="os" /></span><span class="epubonly"><img src="images/os_note.jpg" width='auto' height='25px' alt="ος" /></span>) ligature is

is rendered as ‘<span class="htmlonly">q́₃</span><span class="epubonly">que</span>’. There is a French terminal ‘e’ which appears with a slash
as <img src="images/enote.jpg" width="13" height="18" alt="é" />. This is rendered as ‘<span class="htmlonly">é̩</span><span class="epubonly">[e/]</span>̩’.</p>

<p class='c000'>The index entry for the Latin phrase <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Malè parta, malè dilabuntur</em></span>
includes a reference to p. 502, where it is not mentioned. The emblem associated with
the phrase appears on p. <a href='#i213'>487</a>. The incorrect page reference was retained, but a link is
provided to the correct location.</p>
